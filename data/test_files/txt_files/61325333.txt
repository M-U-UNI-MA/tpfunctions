Late Shri Bhanubhai I. Patel
17-03-1928 ∑ 31-01-2006
The Patriarch has left for the ultimate abode, yet his memories will nestle in eternity. May his life and legacy remain a guiding principle to everyone subscribing to a mission that is Life. The passing away of our Chairman and mentor Shri Bhanubhai Patel has created a vaccum that shall take time to fill. We'll always miss him for the values he instilled in all of us in managing our affairs with the highest standards of business ethics and social responsibilities. His vision, integrity, dynamism and passion for perfection along with perpetual awareness towards all-round development were exemplary. His passing away is a loss that can only be recovered, by following his footsteps.

All achievements begin with an idea!

Society First: A man of empowerment

The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistered by water, nor withered by the wind.
-The Gita

A perspective look at the lifespan of late Shri Bhanubhai I. Patel the founder of Elecon, will reveal a remarkable personality that created history in the national and global technosphere with an unrelenting commitment to exploit state-of-the-art technology while navigating Elecon through 55 glorious years of incessant achievements. The result; Elecon is today, India's largest manufacturer of Material Handling Equipment and Power Transmission Products. A dream that was envisaged in 1951 has blossomed in full glory.
Take a closer look and one is absorbed into the magical charm of this dynamic veteran who was a sheer source of pure energy. Even though an Arts graduate by education, he walked the technology path and strived for excellence while staying a step ahead in technology. Ahead of his time, Shri Bhanubhai not only introduced state-of-theart technologies but also best manufacturing practices with a new approach towards total customer satisfaction.
Baptised with his love for innovative technologies and remarkable willpower Shri Bhanubhai started his career as a Sales Director in Milling Trading Company Private Limited, during which he learned the business and nurtured a dream, to one day

make it big in the industrial arena. Foremost in his mind was `self-reliance' considering the Indian industry in context. For his pioneering spirit, it was reason enough to venture ahead with a mission to realize his dream. This was just the beginning for an individual who loved to challenge the challenge. This committed drive helped him foray into unexplored areas in the engineering world.
A noble and caring human being under a hard shell, he was a true role model for all who worked with him. A sport and art lover, he believed in doing all he did in totality and that life was nothing but an endless process to excel.
This tribute highlights some achievements of Shri Bhanubhai during his captivating years of excellence, experience, expertise and eminence, collectively; ELECON.
The Genesis
Cira 1951. Shri Bhanubhai was born on the 17th of March 1928 and graduated in Arts from Bombay University in 1950. He joined Milling Trading Company Private Limited as Sales Director due to his affinity with technology. Before long, he realised the importance of self-reliance in the engineering industry

and shaped a plan to achieve the same. A moderate start for Elecon with marketing activities for equipment and accessories for Power Plants, Steel and Sugar Mills, Fertilizer Plants, Cement and the Mining industry. These primal years contained therein, infinite promises for the time to come.
In 1962, Elecon shifted its base to a thriving industrial locale of Vallabh Vidyanagar in Gujarat upon an invitation by Shri H. M. Patel (ex. Finance Minister, Government of India). The commitment to excel only grew stronger through each achievement and challenge.
Shri Bhanubhai became the Managing Director in 1968 and took rapid strides that turned Elecon into a brilliant organization in the manufacture of bulk Material Handling Equipment and Power Transmission solutions. Sales zoomed from Rs. 2.5 million in 1962 to exceed Rs. 4,400 million by the year 2005-06.
Radical Vision
The initiatives undertaken by Shri Bhanubhai made progressive impact across the Indian and overseas industry by the use of innovative solutions to heavy application industries such as Thermal Power Stations, Fertilizer Plants, Steel & Cement Plants, Mining Industry, Defence industry and more, which ultimately offered an unprecedented competitive advantage to the Indian Economy as Elecon emerged as a robust element for the growth.
The Drive
Shri Bhanubhai believed in the old adage of "If you think you can, you will" and navigated Elecon through the maze of time with dedication, drive and determination.
Incorporated at a time of uncertainty, Elecon made its mark by continuously engaging in the exploration of new horizons. Then, the

recent independence of the nation meant a time for jubilation, but was just as much, a testing time for those who dared to achieve the unachievable. For young Elecon it was a formidable task.
However, the resolute spirit in Elecon helped achieve a series of landmarks and began offering a wide gamut of engineering products like Conveyors, Material Handling Plants, Gear Transmission Products to core industry sectors including Steel, Fertilizer, Cement, Mining, Power, Ports and Defence.
Today after 55 years of relentless efforts, Elecon has established itself to be an industrial power house contributing its time, energy and skills to building India's backbone in industrial infrastructure and defence. Figuratively, there will always be a bit of Elecon across India.
First Among Equals
Over time, under the able guidance of Shri Bhanubhai, Elecon evolved into a `one stop shop' for bulk Material Handling Equipment and Power Transmission Products. From concept to commissioning, Elecon provides the best in technology, service and quality.
With constant innovation in technology and razor sharp understanding of industry needs, it is little wonder that today, Elecon is the largest manufacturer of a composite range of bulk Material Handling Equipment and Power Transmission products in India.
Conveying systems designed, manufactured and erected to work at the rate of 20,000 tons per hour for the Neyveli Lignite Corporation is the second largest conveying system in the world.
Always A Step Ahead
Graduation in Arts made him love painting, music and sculpture, but responsibilities

of running an engineering conglomerate added the love for technology. A passion for perfection translated into constant adoption and deployment of new technology to produce better products in shorter timeframes with near-zero rejection.
Shri Bhanubhai's drive for perfection further brought about novel methods in business management. Code of ethics was introduced along with new marketing and sales practices and business process reengineering methods.
Global Vision
With the global industry in sight, Shri Bhanubhai inculcated a perfection oriented thought process in all endeavors at Elecon; from raw material procurement to production infrastructure, manufacturing practices, adherence to quality standards and stringent quality control, commitment to research & development, marketing and total customer satisfaction.
An ISO 9001:2000 certification for the Gear Division by world renowned accreditation agency stands as a testimony to Elecon's adherence to globally accepted quality norms. Elecon's growth plan confirms to its organizational belief that excellence is a never ending marathon.
Human Resources - The Force
Shri Bhanubhai truly believed that no sword is mightier than the spirited resolve that wields it. At the heart of Elecon is a

remarkable aspect of people bonding. Career building, constant learning and support, employee mentoring, were some of the essentials introduced and implemented in the Elecon HR policy. In the development of its people lies the motivating force that will propel Elecon into the future.
Commuity Initiatives
Shri Bhanubhai's efforts and contributions are beyond the confinement of corporate excellence, which find their noble presence in millions of transformed lives and social developments benefitting one and all. Being a dynamic visionary, he subscribed to the notion of absolute empowerment, which is quite axiomatic in all his community contributions. Some of the compassionate efforts he endeavoured are:
Education: Knowing that education plays a crucial role to help achieve democratic objectives, he religiously donated to building and caring such institutions including schools, collages, academic trusts and others to pave a better tomorrow.
Healthcare: To heal innocent and needy lives, Shri Bhanubhai helped establish centres with advanced facilities in hospitals and medical institutions to serve people in a caring environment.
Environment: Shri Bhanubhai remained quite emphatic on rewarding the community for the civil good and betterment as he did never limit reforms to corpoarte board rooms. He has played a sigificant role in gifting a new charm and feel to the environment by sponsoring the development of gardens, parks and environment friendly plantation drives.
Aids for National Calamities / Disasters: Needless to say, Shri Bhanubhai always remained at the forefront in aid efforts

whenever a natural calamity hit the nation by funding national aids for reconstruction and rehabilitation and unflinchingly contributed his patriotic dues.
Triumphing Chapters
In heralding an ever contemporary Elecon and to enable the organization flower into an immaculate success story, Shri Bhanubhai consistently endeavored to do more.
Established a sophisticated Gear manufacturing facility with Computerised Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines, to boost production. This CNC technology helped make Elecon a leading manufacturer of Power Transmission products including Codog Marine gearboxes for the Indian Navy.
Employment of more than 2000 people in Elecon and its associate group companies.
Promotion of joint venture companies viz. Ringspann Elecon (India) Limited in collaboration with M/s. Ringspann of Germany and Power Build Elecon Gears Limited in collaboration with M/s. SKK of Japan. Strategic alliances with multiple engineering companies in Europe across multiple product lines.
Establishment of Eimco Elecon (India) Limited by collaborating with Eimco (G.B) Limited - A division of Sandvik Mining & Construction of Sweden to manufacture state-of-the-art mining equipment.
Earning the national pride by being selected to serve national interests such as the Indian Navy and Indian Space Reasearch Organisation.
Accomplished global heights of excellence by earning the distinct accolades of ISO 9001:2000 Certification by TUV Rheinland.

Formation of new age information technology company, Elecon Information Technology Limited to cater to Elecon group's constant drive for advanced technology.
A fact, to keep him embraced in immortality is the heritage of organisations Shri Bhanubhai brought to life. Hand picked from his genius foresightedness, he nurtured them into bright vistas able to meet every premonition he could foresee, which shall now progress as the living tribute.
The Phenomenal Era:
Elecon Engineering Company Limited associates and group Companies:∑ Emtici Engineering Limited, Eimco Elecon (India) Limited, Power Build Limited, Prayas Castings Limited, VVN Mfg & Investa Limited, Power Build Elecon Gears Limited, Ringspann Elecon (India) Limited, Kirloskar Power Build Gears Limited, Elecon Information Technology Limited, Akaaish Mechatronics Limited, Woodpack Corporation, Elecon Singapore Pte. Limited, Elecon Africa (Pty) Limited, Elecon Australia (Pty) Limited, Elecon Middle East FZCO.
The Future
The new millennium means new challenges to be met, new horizons to be explored, new heights to be scaled and new depths to be fathomed. It's a time to brace for change and have the will to metamorphose in a new `Avatar', as an even more progressive enterprise.
It is this time of constant change that this insurmountable loss of Shri Bhanubhai will be felt the most. But, just as most visionaries leave behind legacies, so has Shri Bhanubhai. The two legacies are, Elecon the enterprise and an able navigator in Shri Prayasvin B. Patel to lead the group in its new Avatar.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Annexure 5 to Directors' Report - Item No. 10
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
A) COAL MINING
The Indian Economy has recorded higher growth as per the revised annual estimates, showing 8.4% gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2005-06, surpassing the advance estimate of 8.1%. The growth is significantly higher compared to previous year's 7.5%. In order to sustain the increased growth, as mentioned above, more reforms in the government policies may be necessary in the coming years. The growth during 2005-06 in the mining and quarrying sector recorded a sharp decline to 0.9% from the previous year's level of 5.8%. The above decline in growth can also be attributed to poor fund utilization by various coal companies. It was reported that during the current 5 year plan the fund utilization against the budgetary allocation has been only 37.3%.
The annual coal production has reached a level of 379.6 million tones, indicating an increase of 15% over the previous year. The captive coal mining blocks to private companies produced approximately 17 million tones of coal. Therefore the total coal produced in India during the year 2005-06 is around 397 million tones. While steel, cement, fertilizers, paper and many small & medium industries depend on coal for their energy requirements, the power sector dominates the scene accounting for almost 75% of the consumption of thermal coal. It is, at present, the main driver of the coal demand in the country. The increased requirement of coal from the power sector has left a gap of almost 50 million tones between the demand & supply. The above gap was partially created by the fact that the plant load factor for the power plants has improved from 75 per cent to 80-85 percent due primarily to increased demand from all other power dependent segment of the economy.
It is expected that in 2006-07, coal requirement for power generation would reach a level of 330 million tones.
FUTURE SCENARIO
This has been envisaged based on available

statistics that there will be a wide gap between production and demand of coal in the country in time to come. As per present estimates demand of coal is expected to be around 473.18 MT by end of 10th five year plan (March 31, 2007) and 710 MT by end of 11th plan (March 31, 2012) whereas indigenous production is likely to be around 400 MT only by end of 10th five year plan (March 31, 2007). Even if production during 2006-07 i.e. by end of 10th plan is taken to be roughly 400 MT (Estimated to be 350 MT but Coal Cos. have been directed to increase same by 25 MT) there will be need to produce more coal to meet future demand and as such tremendous scope to push present range of equipment manufactured by your company as well as Equipment involving New Technologies being adopted world wide. Ministry of Coal, Government of India is planning massive investments in the coal Sector during balance of current 10th - 5 year plan ending March 2007 and also during 11th - 5 year plan ending March 2012 to increase production to minimize gap between production and demand in years to come. Coal Vision 2025 team formulated by TERI as per the directions of Coal Ministry has estimated a demand of 1.26 billion tones of coal in 2025 with an anticipated GDP growth of 8%. In fact it was announced recently by Coal India Limited ≠ an arm of Govt. of India and major coal producer ≠ that an investment of Rs. 21,000 Cr. is expected to be made by them to develop 99 new Coal Projects. Apart from above Ministry has initiated allotment of the coal blocks to private entrepreneurs such as power plants or steel and cement producing organizations for development which were originally reserved for Coal India Limited, which accounts for 90 percent of the country's coal out put, to increase production to meet demand of coal in future in the country. Mines containing estimated reserves of around 17-18 billion tones have already been allotted to 94 companies in both the public & private sectors. It is expected that these private & public sectors would produce 300 ≠ 400 million tones of coal from above mines for their captive use by 2010-11. In view of above developments on coal production growth in coming years it is clear

24

EIMCO ELECON (INDIA) LIMITED

that more Mining equipment will be required to be deployed to meet increased target of production.
Present scenario indicates the production from Opencast Mines is contributing to nearly 80% of the Total Production with the balance 20% coming from Underground Mines and as such enhanced mechanization of Open Cast as well as Underground Mines would be required to sustain the production at targeted levels to tap our largest reserves of coal (approx. 197 billion tones).
At present, intermediate technology of SDL/LHD is being used successfully, with LHDs gradually replacing SDLs wherever possible. The SDL/LHDs are fast replacing the Manual-Loading labour who are declining in numbers steadily, over the years. However, since the SDLs/LHDs have reached their peak productivity levels and since skilled manpower is getting scarcer, alternative mining methods such as Continuous Mining Equipment which are less manpower intensive and return higher productivity are being explored for the future. The issue of mechanization is being addressed seriously by coal producing organizations due to the declining trend in manpower over the years.
Keeping in view above it has been felt the Continuous Miner Technology for Underground Mining would provide the solution. In case of Underground Mining the Continuous Mining holds the potential for attaining far greater productivity as compared to that of SDL/LHD.
Our Company being pioneer in Underground Mining Equipment and first to introduce intermediate technology in Indian Mines long back with established market for present range of products took a timely decision to meet challenges of future for Mechanization of Coal Mines in India for higher productivity by adding various State-of-the-Art Mining Equipment such as Continuous Miners, Face and Roof Drills, Coal Haulers etc. for Mechanization of Underground Mines and 160 mm and 250 mm self propelled crawler mounted Blast Hole Drills for Opencast Mines to enhance production of coal to meet demand of future. Our Company is expected to reap the benefits of above product introductions in the future. It is expected that the new products would result in increased business commensurate with the growth of related segment.

OPPORTUNITIES & THREATS
In the current financial year it is expected that ACM-10 Continuous Miner will be deployed in a coal mine. The above will open-up a new range of applications for our products.
The 250 mm Blast Hole Drill is likely to be approved for regular use in coal mines. Apart from above deployment of 160 mm Blast Hole Drill is expected to create opportunities in open cast mine applications.
During the previous year the Company has successfully integrated the Welding Robot & Laser Cutting machines in the new production process. The new manufacturing process implemented, utilizing welding robot, has reduced the throughput time at the same time has also generated additional machining capacity out of existing machine tools without any additions. The alternate sources of procurement for standard brought-out parts have also resulted in optimizing our manufacturing cost of some of our models.
B) As anticipated the prices of Copper & Zinc over the last one year have appreciated considerably. In the process earlier non-viable projects are seeing the light of the day. It is expected that both the above segments along with Gold, Uranium & Manganese should do well in the current financial year.
OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY
With the revival of investment climate in coal companies, your Company is expected to do better in the coming years.
RISKS AND CONCERNS
The main risk and concern of the company remains that it is almost entirely dependent virtually on one Govt. client and few products. While the company cannot do much to substantially increase its client base, being entirely dependent on Government's Minerals Policies.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
The Company's internal control systems are adequate, considering size and nature of operation of the company, to meet regulatory/statutory requirements.
