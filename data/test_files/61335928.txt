Dividend Considering the past accumulated losses, your Directors do not propose any dividend on Equity Shares for the year ended March 31, 2007.
Operating & Financial Performance
The year under review has again shown a bright trend for the air conditioning market. The industry has clocked above 1.50 Mn units with a growth rate of approx 20% over last year. The penetration level for the Air Conditioners still stands at 1.5-2%. Top Metros still are the major hubs for its sale.

There is continuity in the high growth rate of demand for the Split ACs and this is shown in the figures of your company also. The contribution for the Split AC in industry has gone upto 45%. The change is mainly due to narrowing down of the pricing differential between the Window AC and Split AC and Change in Indian Consumer taste who has become more discerning.

The capacity enhancement across industry involves massive investments in the infrastructure development. The demographic trends; rising income levels, increase in domestic consumption and strong economic momentum are all adding to the industrial capex. Sizeable Capex is lined up for both in manufacturing and the Service sector especially in retail IT & ITES services. All these factors have contributed to the growth in our commercial category which includes products like Ductable ACs and Chillers. We also foresee a bright opportunity for the category in years to come.

The trend of importing the low cost air conditioners by established players as well as the Chinese players continued this year also. Your company managed to retain the High Quality Position and hence retained the price realisation in spite of stiff competition. This was made possible by the consistent performance of delivery by marketing, sales and supply chain of your company. The year also saw the introduction of 16.5 Tr Ductable and `Vi series' concept marketing by your company. The introduction of 16.5 Tr Ductable is surely going to be a trend setter in the category. `Vi series' is a step forward in our value selling marketing concept.

The Room Air conditioners are driven by the increasing consumerism, higher income levels, low cost consumer credit and rising aspirations. This industry is perceived as one of the fastest growing industries amongst consumer durables.
The emergence of many new brands and low cost brands from china has put a pressure on the manufacturers to decrease the price for the desired sales volumes. Your company has maintained its prices and at the same time has ensured the achievement of the volume targets set for itself. The price drop has been curtailed by providing a value proposition for the customers. The company has been able to successfully stabilise the concept of Atom + One in the market. The company has also launched the new IOTA Split AC as a technologically superior air conditioner over the existing Split AC Sense i. The emergence of these products as technologically superior flagship brands and replacing the well established older ones has reaffirmed the positioning of HHLI as a technological leader and an innovative brand.
The Chillers category of business has also added to our growth spree and has shown a growth of nearly 40% over last year. This year also saw the introduction of high capacity chillers in this segment.
Your Company has made Operating Profit (Profit before Depreciation, Interest and Tax) of Rs. 291.75 Mn. for the year ended March 31, 2007 as against Rs. 230.27 Mn. for the year ended March 31, 2006 and made net profit after tax of Rs. 193.27 Mn. during the year under review as compared to a net profit of Rs. 148.56 Mn. for previous year.
Future Prospects
In the current year your company is growing in its established line of business and at the same time is stabilising in new lines of business of Refrigerators and Washing Machines.
The Refrigerators and Washing Machines which are imported CBUs were introduced in the financial year 2005-06 and have now established in the market. In keeping with our philosophy of doing business these products have been selected after lot of care and promise to keep consumers delighted through HHLI offerings. The range of Split AC, Chillers and Ductables will help maintain healthy operating margins and at the same time reduce the impact of seasonality from our business operations. This will help in overcoming the pressure to perform in the season only.
The year under review also saw the implementation of software based Service Management System. This was a step further in the philosophy of customer focus that our company has embarked upon. This, in synergy with customer care, will surely help enhance our efficiencies for the consumer response for handling service related queries.
This year also saw our advertising communication upgrading to next phase. The concept based selling which we started last year has been taken further. We have introduced now the concept of beauty for our range of products. The gamut of beauty is much more than physical aspects of the products and comprises of all the parameters which are important for the customer delight. The new range will be called as `Vi Series' (pronounced as `Be') Series. It will comprise of Window AC, Split AC, Refrigerators and Washing Machines. It is visually depicted by a Japanese character giving a strong association with the Japanese superior technology. The new concept not only provides a strong association to what our product stands for but at the same time brings in synergy for our overall communication.
To summarize Indian Air-conditioning industry is growing at a hectic pace and is providing a huge opportunity for all the players. The market has overall done well. The product mix is changing towards high value Split AC. Your company with presence in both residential and commercial air-conditioning is poised to best utilize the opportunity provided. Hence your company has set up a target to grow at a higher than the industry rate in Split AC & Ductable categories in the coming financial year. The outlook for the new segment of Refrigerators and Washing Machines is positive and seeing the new products getting established, promises a bright and sustaining future.
Hence the outlook for your company remains positive.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Hitachi Home & Life Solutions (India) Limited (HHLI) has been engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of range of air conditioners in Indian and selected markets outside India, While the range of Room Air Conditioners and Packaged Air conditioners are being manufactured in India the company sources the higher end of air-conditioning systems like chillers and set free from its affiliated companies worldwide. It is also engaged in the business of trading for the Refrigerators and Washing Machines.
Industry Structure & Developments
Consumer Appliances Industry The Indian consumer durable industry is estimated to be in the range of Rs 250,000 Mn. The home appliances industry (products that your company deals in) is estimated to be around Rs 87,500 Mn. Refrigerators contribute to the largest share of this at around Rs 38,000 Mn. followed by Room Air Conditioners at around Rs 27,500 Mn. and Washing Machines at 14,000 Mn.
Air Conditioning Industry The Indian air-conditioning industry is witnessing a radical change. There is a significant trend of the growing demand for the branded products. This has resulted in to reduction of the share of the unorganized sector. The simplification of fiscal structure of duties has put up all the players on the equal platform. Also there has been an increase in the awareness and need for more of value added features in the air conditioners. The air conditioner industry enjoys the highest growth as a category in the appliances and is expected to grow over 20% in the years to come. The Ductable and the central airconditioning system (CAS) which contributes to over Rs. 9,000 Mn. has been buoyant in the recent years and the growth in this category has exceeded 20%. This can be mainly attributed to the sizable capex rise both in the manufacturing and service sector especially in the IT and ITES services.
Room Air Conditioners The category consists of both the Window AC and Split AC for the use in residential and commercial spaces. The increase in the affordability levels and high ambient temperatures experienced in the summer months are the key growth drivers for the AC market in India. Growing aspiration levels, purchase power of consumers and easy availability of finance schemes are the factors which have resulted in the acceptance of air conditioners as the utility items rather than a luxury one in many households and are now one in many preference list of household items. Your company has introduced a new product in Splits AC `IOTA' at an aggressive price point to catch on the trend. This price point is still at approximately 50% premium over the market average price.
Commercial range of Air Conditioners The commercial air-conditioning comprises of both the Ductable Split AC and Large sized chillers. These find usage in the entire commercial sector comprising restaurants, retail shops, banks, offices, malls, supermarkets. The market for this segment is expected to grow in the range of 20-25%. The gamut of usage for the segment has increased. The huge opportunity provided has seen a large number of global players entering this segment and the competition is going to heat up in near future. HHLI with its range of Microcool Ductable is committed to doing well in this sector. This year saw the launch of new 16.5 Tr Ductable by HHLI in this segment. This is unique because first time in India your company has launched a truly convertible Ductable Air conditioner. Convertible means that it can be suspended from ceiling or can be mounted on the floor. Hence this product not only caters to the consultant's specification but also adds to the architects delight. In the chiller division your company has launched large capacity chillers. HHLI will be able to leverage its strength of technically sound exclusive dealers across India who share HHLI value system of delivering high level of customer satisfaction.
Refrigerators and Washing Machines HHLI introduced 3- Door Refrigerators and Big Capacity Washing Machines last year. These are imported from Hitachi factory in Thailand. The concept of 3-Door and the top loading fully automatic washing machines in large capacities is gaining popularity in India. We have been able to stabilize in sales. HHLI has strategically decided to operate in the premium range in this segment. HHLI is poised to grow in this segment.
Product Group Wise Performance
HHLI is in the forefront in Indian Air-conditioning industry with many firsts to its credit. HHLI has always pioneered in technology and innovation. HHLI has always been far ahead than the competition in introducing newer concepts and features in the air-conditioning. We were first one to introduce products like Hi-Wall Split AC, Remote controlled ACs, ACs with Plus one Technology to name a few. We have always been considered as a technology powerhouse rendering solutions for the Indian Homes. The consistent efforts of marketing and sales team to position our offerings as differentiated products in the market place has helped HHLI to become the major company in the "Mass Premium" category.
In the room air conditioners, our company has introduced New IOTA Split AC. Atom+One and Quadricool TM together with IOTA have reaffirmed HHLI's place as the innovation leader in the minds of Indian consumer. Because of its strong focus on quality of products and standards which are stricter than the Indian standards, HHLI has become a brand of choice in the consumers' mind. We have been able to capture sizeable premium on our products and also maintain our market share.
In the Ductable category, HHLI has repeated the trend of outperforming the market and has grown at a rate of 27% over last year. The addition of new 16.5 Tr truly convertible Ductable Microcool air conditioner surely is going to help your company to repeat history this year also. We have set for ourselves much higher growth targets.
HHLI through its imported screw chillers and addition of roof tops and large capacity chillers is poised to grow in a segment which is set to grow at a tremendous pace.

Hitachi Home & Life Solutions (India) Limited
Brand Equity HHLI has been consistently pursuing the brand building activities to ensure positive associations with the brand. It is pursuing the overall customer focus and all its operations have been oriented for the customer. We have evolved to a stage wherein we are having the concept communication rather than the product communication. We transcend the communication to the destination concept visualization which forms an interactivity point of the customer and hence is able to orient the product features towards the concept for the benefit of the customer. Also by unification of our communication and a strategy to have round the year presence in the customers' mind has made us think of innovative ways to induce positive association for the brand.
Future Outlook- Threats, Opportunities The reduction of the price gap between the Split AC (SAC) and Window AC (WAC) has fuelled the growth of the Split AC segment. The phenomenal growth of the Split AC segment can also be attributed to high disposable income of consumers, their aesthetic looks and less noise compared to the Window AC. Your company has recently introduced Iota and Atom + one which will form the flagship brands for fuelling our growth in the Splits. As a result of growth in SAC the impact has shown on the WAC Category. While the growth of WAC is stagnant in the market, your company expects de-growth in the WAC segment. The emergence of retail is a new opportunity for the company which will form a bulk buyer for our range of products. It will uplift the sales of Commercial Air Conditioning segment (Ductables and Chillers) on its Infrastructure development and will form a major bulk buyer for RAC, Refrigerators & Washing Machines during its operations. At the same time your company understands that the advent and full development of retail will result in the erosion of the profit margins for your company in the long run due to bully buying by these retailers. In the Refrigerators, the market is expected to be driven by the frost free refrigerators. The penetration levels although better than Air conditioners still are low and has a huge untapped potential. Overall the segment is expected to have a 10-12% growth. The washing machines are seeing price erosion especially in the top loading fully automatic segment. Your company with a host of unique features has been able to maintain it's pricing and is committed to grow. Pricing however remains a challenge. To summarize India is poised to grow so is your company. HHLI remains committed in its endeavor to be a profitable venture.
Human Resources The number of Staff at HHLI as on March 31, 2007 was 293. Achievement & Performance of the vision of any Organization lies on the commitment of every employee towards attaining them. HHLI has felt the above need and has made a conscious effort to attain and continuously improve a desired high level of performance at Individual level. HHLI launched a Goal based Performance Management System - Goal Setting & Monitoring (GSM) System for performance mapping. The 3-Tier objective of the GSM system was to attain High monetary rewards for performance, career planning based on Annual Appraisals & Development plan for employee. The focus on training & development was reinforced during the year. Development initiatives were taken with a view to align business priorities with aspiration of employees leading to development of self & organization. HHLI developed various programs like Management Development Program (MDP) in collaboration with IIM-A. Out Bound Training (OBT) programs were organized for Team Building purpose. As a focus on Behavioral Training Program, a Transcendental Meditation (TM) training program had also been organised.
Taking the Knowledge management initiative forward, HHLI this year launched i2i, an intranet portal to integrate information with intelligence. i2i represents a coordinated view of our People & Organization.
During 06-07 HHLI also upgraded few best capable Operators to Staff so as to foster motivation and innovation in the environment. HHLI also recognized the Long Term Association and services given by Employees for growth & development of the organization.

The accounting policies applied by the Company are consistent with those used in the previous year.

2.2 Accounting estimates The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (`GAAP') requires that management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Any difference between the actual result and estimates are recognised in the period in which the results are known or materialise.
2.3 Fixed assets and depreciation

Cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Financing costs relating to acquisition of fixed assets are also included to the extent they relate to the period till such assets are ready to be put to use.

These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Warranty Costs Provision for warranty costs is determined on the basis of management estimate of product wise liability and is calculated based on analysis of actual costs incurred in earlier years.
2.9 Income Taxes Tax expense comprises current, deferred & fringe benefit tax. Current income-tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Indian Income Tax Act. Deferred income tax reflects the impact of current year timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the year and reversal of timing differences of earlier years. Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised. If the company has carry forward of unabsorbed depreciation and tax losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is virtual certainty backed by convincing evidence that such deferred tax assets can be realised against future taxable profits. Unrecognised deferred tax assets of earlier years are re-assessed and recognised to the extent that it has become reasonably certain that future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realized.
2.10 Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credit MAT credit is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the company will pay normal income tax during the specified period. In the year in which the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit becomes eligible to be recognized as an asset in accordance with the recommendations contained in guidance Note issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the said asset is created by way of a credit to the profit and loss account and shown as MAT Credit Entitlement. The Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date and writes down the carrying amount of MAT Credit Entitlement to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that Company will pay normal Income Tax during the specified period.
2.11 Earnings Per Share (EPS) Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.12 Leases Leases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased term, are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the Profit and Loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets given under a finance lease are recognised as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The principal amount received reduces the net investment in the lease. Initial direct cost such as legal cost, brokerage costs, etc. are recognized in the profit and loss account.

18 The Company was recognizing and accruing the Retirement Benefits as per the erstwhile Accounting Standard (AS) ­ 15 on "Retirement Benefits" till March 31, 2006. The ICAI has revised AS -15 on "Employee Benefits" and had made it mandatory w.e.f. April 01, 2006. Subsequently on December 07, 2006, ICAI postponed the applicability of the standard for accounting periods commencing on or after December 07, 2006. However the company has decided for early adoption of revised AS -15 w.e.f. April 01, 2006.
In accordance with the transitional provision of revised AS 15, the incremental liability at the beginning of the year aggregating to Rs.3,984 has been charged to the Profit and Loss account.

Necessary disclosure in this regard are as follows:
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has completed five years or more of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days salary (last drawn salary) for each completed year of service. The scheme is funded with an insurance company in the form of a qualifying insurance policy.

The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognized in the profit and loss account and the funded status and amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the respective plans.
