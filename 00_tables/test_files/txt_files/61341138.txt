4 Chairman's Statement

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

The Group reported a decline in turnover and a loss for the financial year ended March 31, 2010. The reduction in sales was largely due to poor consumer sentiment resulting from the economic crisis compounded by keen market competition. Strong operational initiatives were taken during the year to reduce the negative impact that the poor economy had on the business, hence the Group is content with core operations remaining sound and healthy. During the year, the Group sought to settle its longrunning dispute with the Hong Kong Tax authority, eventually arriving at a settlement that caused the Group to report a loss position. However, due to the one-time nature of the settlement, it will not have an impact on the Group's results in the new financial year.
The Group continues to invest in research and development that leads to new and innovative products for sustaining business growth and revenue. Some new ODM/OEM customers have duly come on stream this year. The Group will continue to explore new business opportunities with Oregon Scientific and its private label customers.

collaborations with external business partners where the Group can leverage on their design, technical and manufacturing capabilities. The Group has enhanced and will continue to strengthen its supply chain management and lean manufacturing competencies, thereby increasing production efficiency and inventory control.
APPRECIATION On behalf of the Board, I would like to extend my gratitude to our management team and staff for their tireless efforts and commitment to serving the Group during these challenging times. I would also like to specially thank my directors for their guidance and assistance and our customers, suppliers, bankers, business partners and shareholders for their continuous support and confidence in the Group.

DIVIDENDS The Directors do not recommend the payment of any dividend for the year (2009: 1 Singapore cent).

PROSPECTS In light of the current economic and market conditions, the Group expects to continue facing stiff business challenges ahead. Focus will be placed on developing innovative products that contribute higher margins. Priority will be given to strengthening

Operations Review 5

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

OVERVIEW The financial year of 2010 was a challenging year for the Group. The Group recorded a turnover of HK$581.8 million representing a decrease of 8% as compared with last year. The decline in turnover was mainly attributed to the decrease in sales to Oregon Scientific by 17%. Although gross profit margin was improved, the decrease in turnover, the increase in operating expenses, and recognition of a one time tax provision, there was resulted a loss of HK$59.4 million (2009: profit of HK$19.5 million).
Our strategy is to produce higher end products with unique design, innovation and technology that serve the needs of the consumers for both Oregon Scientific and ODM/OEM/private label customers. The Group will continue to invest in research and development for new technologies and to strengthen its collaboration with external technology and business partners.
The Group has undertaken key initiatives to improve its operational efficiency by overhauling its supply chain management and implementing lean manufacturing for its production. This will help to shorten manufacturing and delivery lead time, reduce inventory holdings and eliminate wastage.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION Turnover of the Group for the year was HK$581.8 million, representing a decrease of 8% as compared to HK$634.1 million last year. Gross profit increased by HK$2.0 million, or 2%, to HK$122.3 million, while gross profit margin increased from 19% to 21% mainly due to change in sales and product mix.

The operating loss for the year amounted to HK$2.1 million compared to an operating profit of HK$22.0 million last year. Net loss after tax for the year amounted to HK$59.4 million compared to a net profit after tax of HK$19.5 million last year.

Trade receivables as at March 31, 2010 increased by 4% to HK$140.3 million as compared with 2009, and 58% of the outstanding balances were due from related companies. The Group maintains a very stringent credit policy with terms of trade normally based on letters of credit and open account to selected customers who have long business relationships with the Group and are in a healthy financial position.
Inventory level as at March 31, 2010 increased by 71% to HK$37.6 million as compared with 2009. Inventory turnover days was 30 days as compared with 16 days last year.
SALES SEGMENTATION BY PRODUCT GROUP AND GEOGRAPHICAL MARKET The development of innovative timekeeping and weather forecast equipments, sports and fitness and personal healthcare products are the core competency of the Group. These products are broadly divided into four main categories ­ Sports and Healthcare Products, Environmental Monitoring Devices, Timing Devices, and Other Products and Services. The Group is dedicated to ensuring every product it creates fully satisfies the needs of its customers, who embrace active lifestyles and appreciate new technologies, and are environmental and health conscious.
Sports and Healthcare Product was the largest product category which accounted for 37% (2009: 29%) of the Group's turnover. This product category covers sport watches, swimming watches, weather forecast watches, fitness and bicycle computers, pulse meters, pedometers, blood-pressure meters, fat and weight monitoring devices.

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

Environmental Monitoring Devices was the second largest product category which accounted for 30% (2009: 37%) of the Group's turnover. This product category comprises a wide range of weather forecasting, monitoring and measurement devices, all using LCDs. They include thermometers, humidity monitors, barometers, UV detectors, weather radio alert systems and remote sensors, as well as home weather stations that track weather conditions and trends. Operating on wireless links using radio frequency (RF) technology to connect with the remote sensors placed outdoors or away from the main unit, these products provide the perfect solution for home and office.

Timing Devices accounted for 14% (2009: 9%) of the Group's turnover and comprise a range of specialist timekeepers and clocks that allow their users to count the minutes and seconds more easily and with greater precision. This category of products includes projection timing devices, high-visibility LCDs, clocks that automatically adjust to daylight-saving time and leap years. Another key feature of these products is their ability to synchronize with the world's most accurate timekeepers in four main markets that use radio time signals (i.e. the UK, Europe, Japan and the USA).

The Other Products and Services category accounted for 19% of the Group's total revenue (2009: 25%). This product category includes LCD electronic accessories, such as smartcard readers and trading products which are not manufactured by the Group but sourced from partnership suppliers.

The Group increased its spending on research and development during the year to HK$34.0 million, comparable to approximately 5.8% of its sales revenue. To maintain its market leadership, the Group has sought to develop "pioneering" products in terms of technology or application, and that are also capable of generating higher gross margin and profits. The approach has been effective in ensuring the most efficient use of internal resources for generating maximum returns.
Sales to Asia Pacific were higher than last year by 6%. Sales to Europe and Americas decreased by 12% and 19% respectively. Europe continued to be the largest market of the Group accounting for 43% (2009: 45%) of the Group's turnover whilst Americas contributed 22% (2009: 25%) and Asia Pacific 35% (2009: 30%).
MANUFACTURING Located in Xixiang, Shenzhen, the PRC, and meeting international standards at all operation levels, the Group's consolidated manufacturing facilities have contributed significantly to the Group's effective cost control and optimized operational efficiencies. They are also proof of the Group's commitment to providing the best possible working environment to its staff.
The Group's Xixiang plant has manufacturing and assembly operations including surface mount technology, wire-bonding facilities, precision plastic molding and mould-making facilities. These production facilities are centralized to allow the Group full control on all and every aspect of production. Employing the latest and best equipment and technologies, the Group

7

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

is able to streamline operation and reduce costs in different areas from manufacturing to transportation. Outsourcing to factories with outstanding track records helps improve cost efficiency and maintain the Group's competitiveness. The Group has upgraded and invested in manufacturing facilities and processes to fully comply with RoHS requirements.
The Xixiang facilities also serve as a showcase of the Group's commitment to providing working conditions conducive to the welfare of staff. International visitors to the plant have returned with positive comments. They are impressed with the advanced manufacturing facilities as well as the favorable working environment and conditions including the high standard accommodation, catering and leisure facilities for staff.

The Group is supported by a loyal, experienced and dedicated team and will continue to position itself as a good corporate employer committed to ensuring job satisfaction and career growth for its people. By providing training, competitive remuneration packages and other career development programs to its staff, the Group hopes to enrich the skills of its people and prepare them for the challenges ahead. The directors strongly believe that a good and dedicated workforce, a healthy balance sheet and new innovations in LCD and microprocessor applications combined will see the Group achieve long-term success to the benefit of both its employees and shareholders in the years ahead.

The Group will continue to develop strong vendor partnership for manufacturing support. This strategy provides manufacturing capability to meet capacity demands.
PERSONNEL As at March 31, 2010, the Group had 2,029 employees against 1,828 as at March 31, 2009.

For effective and efficient execution of its responsibilities, the Board has established and delegated certain functions to the Audit Committee ("AC"), Nominating Committee ("NC") and Remuneration Committee ("RC"). Each of the AC, NC and RC has its own written terms of reference.

Dr. Raymond Chan assumes the role of both the chairman and the chief executive officer of the Company. The Board is of the view that this has not compromised accountability and independent decisionmaking for the following reasons:
1. the non-executive directors form the majority of the Board of which three out of five directors are independent; and
2. the independent directors actively participate in Board meetings. Through discussions with the chairman and among themselves during Board meetings and beyond on pertinent issues affecting the affairs and business of the Group, these independent directors challenge the proposals and directions of the management, thus enabling the Board to benefit from the objective judgement.
Dr. Chan is one of the founders and a substantial shareholder of the Company and has considerable industry experience. The Board is of the view that it is in the best interests of the Group to have an executive chairman so that the Board, and in particular the non-executive directors, can have the benefit of a chairman who is knowledgeable about the business of the Group and is capable to guide discussions and brief the Board in a timely manner on pertinent issues and developments to facilitate open dialogue between the Board and the management. He is also motivated to contribute to the growth and profitability of the Group.
While serving as a chairman responsible for the proceedings of the Board, Dr. Chan also leads the management in setting overall strategies, objectives and mission and is responsible for the day-to-day business of the Group assisted by the executive director and the management team in carrying out his executive duties. He oversees the Group's operations and business activities and is responsible for the effective implementation of the Group's business strategies and internal control.

NOMINATING COMMITTEE Principle 4: Board membership

Principle 5: Board performance

The NC comprises two independent non-executive directors, Mr. Albert Wang and Mr. Liu Tieh Ching, Brandon and one executive director, Dr. Raymond Chan. Mr. Albert Wang is the chairman of the NC.

The operations of the NC are regulated by its charter, which was approved and is subject to review from time to time by the Board. The principal functions of the NC are as follows:

·

with reference to the guidance notes of the 2005 Code, to

propose to the Board, for approval and implementation, the

assessment process and criteria for evaluating the overall

competency and effectiveness of the Board as a whole;

·

accordance with such assessment process and criteria;

·

Board any new Board appointments or re-

appointments of directors having regard to

their contribution and performance; and

·

to assess annually the independence of the

directors in accordance with the guidelines on

independence as set out in the 2005 Code.

The NC met once during the year and performed, inter alia, the following functions:

·

adopted and recommended the Board to

approve the qualitative criteria for assessing

effectiveness of the Board collectively as a

whole;

·

implemented board evaluation process to assess

the Board's performance based on the adopted

criteria;

·

considered and recommended directors to

retire by rotation and seek re-election at the

forthcoming annual general meeting; and

·

independence of directors based on individual

director's declaration.

The NC initiated and implemented the board evaluation process. The objective of the evaluation process is to assess and identify areas for continuous improvement to the Board's overall effectiveness.

It is conducted by way of a board evaluation questionnaire through which each director is required to complete and to assess individually the Board as a whole on several parameters namely, the Board's understanding on the Group's business operations, the development of strategic directions, effectiveness of Board meetings to facilitate focus and progress on important organisational matters, the capability in monitoring progress of strategic objectives set by the Board and the adequacy of the Group's business operations to maximize shareholders' interest. The consolidated findings are reported and recommendations are made to the Board for consideration for further improvements to help the Board to discharge its duties more effectively. The NC is of the view that such annual evaluation exercise is a form of good Board management practice.

ACCESS TO INFORMATION Principle 6: Access to information
The Board is furnished with complete and adequate information in a timely manner to allow the directors to discharge their duties properly. Papers submitted to the Board by management provide information on the background and justification for each proposal or mandate sought, including where applicable, relevant budgets, forecasts and projections. Other than in exceptional circumstances, regular quarterly meeting papers, consist of consolidated profit and loss accounts, analysis of sales, operating profit, pre-tax and attributable profit by major divisions as compared against the budgets, together with explanations for significant variances for the quarter and year-to-date, are circulated to each director at least three days before the relevant Board meeting for review and consideration to keep him/her informed of the Group's performance, position and prospects. Key decisions are reserved for discussions at Board meetings, rather than by circulation of resolutions. Senior management staff will be invited to attend Board meetings to give briefings and answer any queries that the directors may have on the operations and planning of the Group.
The directors have separate and independent access to the Group's senior management and company secretary at all times. The directors are given access to obtain independent professional advice as and when necessary in furtherance of their duties. The appointment of such professional advisors is subject to the approval by the Board.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Principle 7: Procedures for developing remuneration policies
Principle 8: Level and mix of remuneration
The RC comprises three independent non-executive directors, Mr. Liu Tieh Ching, Brandon, Mr. Albert Wang and Mr. Li Kwan In. Mr. Liu Tieh Ching, Brandon is the chairman of the RC. In discharging their duties, the members have access to the advice from the internal human resources personnel, and if required, the advice from outside expert.
The operations of the RC are regulated by its charter, which was approved and is subject to review from time to time by the Board. The main duty of the RC is to review and recommend to the Board an appropriate and competitive framework of remuneration for the Board and key executives of the Group.

The RC met once during the year to review and make recommendations concerning the existing framework of remuneration for directors serving on the Board and on the Board Committees as well as key executives of the Group including the performance-based element or equity incentives such as share options to be incorporated in the remuneration framework. In reviewing the remuneration packages of the directors and key executives of the Group, the RC took into consideration the industry practices and norms for remuneration packages, the market and pay conditions within the industry and in comparable companies as well as the Group's performance and individual performance.
The RC also recommended directors' fees for the nonexecutive directors having made reference to the effort and time spent and their level of responsibility. All directors are recommended by the RC to be paid a basic fee. Additional fees are payable to a director for appointment to a particular committee. The recommendations made by the RC in respect of directors' fees for directors are subject to approval by shareholders at annual general meetings.
A director in the RC abstains from making any recommendation in connection with his personal remuneration. No service agreements have been entered into between any of the directors and the Company.
REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS OF DIRECTORS AND TOP FIVE EXECUTIVES Principle 9: Disclosure on remuneration
The Company has entered into a management service agreement with a subsidiary of IDT International Limited ("IDTI"), the ultimate holding company of the Company, by which the Group engages the management services of IDTI and its subsidiaries ("IDTI Group"). The fees payable for such management services include, among other things, the Group's share of certain executive directors' remuneration of IDTI Group. The management services are included in the interested person transactions mandate approved by shareholders of the Company at the last annual general meeting held on July 28, 2009 and is subject to renewal at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

The 2005 Code requires the remuneration of at least the top 5 key executives who are not directors of the Company to be disclosed within bands of S$250,000. The Company believes that disclosure of the remuneration of individual executives is disadvantageous to its business interests, given its highly competitive industry conditions coupled with sensitivity and confidentiality of staff remuneration matters.

During the year under review, no employee whose remuneration exceeded S$150,000 was related to the chairman and chief executive officer or other directors of the Company.

AUDIT COMMITTEE Principle 11: Audit Committee

The AC comprises three independent non-executive directors, Mr. Albert Wang, Mr. Liu Tieh Ching, Brandon and Mr. Li Kwan In. Mr. Albert Wang is the chairman of the AC. The Board is of the opinion that the AC members have accounting and/or related financial management expertise and are appropriately qualified to discharge their responsibilities. The operations of the AC are regulated by its charter, which was approved and is subject to review from time to time by the Board.

The principle duties of the AC include, inter alia, the following:

·

to assist the Board in discharging its statutory

and other responsibilities on internal controls,

financial and accounting matters, compliance,

business and financial risks management;

·

to review the adequacy of the Company's

internal financial controls, operational and

compliance controls, and risk management

policies and systems established by the

management;

·

to review the quarterly and annual financial

announcements before they are endorsed by

the Board;

·

to review the audit plans of the external

auditors and internal auditors;

·

to review the cost effectiveness of the audit,

the independence and objectivity of the

external auditors annually and the nature and

extent of all non-audit services provided by the

external auditors;

·

to review the external auditors' and internal

auditors' evaluation of the system of internal

accounting controls;

·

to review the reports of the external auditors

and internal auditors and consider the

effectiveness of responses/actions taken by

management on the audit recommendations

and observations;

·

to make recommendations to the Board on

the appointment, re-appointment and removal

of the external auditors, and approving the

remuneration and terms of engagement of the

external auditors;

·

to review arrangements by which staff of the

Company may, in confidence, raise concerns

about possible improprieties in matters of

financial reporting or other matters. The AC

is to ensure arrangements are in place for the

independent investigation of such matters and

for appropriate follow up action; and

·

to review the interested person transactions.

17

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

The AC has explicit authority to investigate any matters within the scope of its duties, and has power to obtain independent professional advice. It has been given full access to and cooperation by the management and reasonable resources to discharge its duties properly and full discretion to invite other directors or executives to attend its meetings. The external auditors and internal auditors were also invited to make presentations to the AC as appropriate. At least once annually, the AC meets the external and internal auditors without the presence of the management.
During the financial year under review, the AC held four meetings to carry out its duties set out in its charter. It also met with the internal and external auditors, each separately without the presence of management. The AC reviewed the adequacy of the internal audit function and is satisfied that the team is adequately resourced and has appropriate standing within the Company. Having reviewed the nature and extent of the non-audit services provided to the Group for FY2009/2010, the AC is of the opinion that the provision of such non-audit services would not affect the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. The AC has recommended to the Board the nomination of Deloitte & Touche LLP for re-appointment.
The Group has in place a whistle-blowing procedure where staff of the Group can raise in confidence concerns or possible improprieties relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls and auditing matters. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow up action.
The AC reviewed the interested person transactions to ensure that current procedures for monitoring of interested person transactions had been complied with. These transactions are reviewed quarterly with the internal auditors and annually with the external auditors. The AC is satisfied that the guidelines and review procedures established to monitor interested person transactions have been complied with.
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND AUDITS Principle 12: Internal Controls
Principle 13: Internal Audit
Structure The Company has an adequately resourced internal audit function ("IA") provided by a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDT International Limited. The IA reports functionally to the AC and administratively to the executive directors. The head of IA meets regularly with the executive directors and attends each quarterly meeting of the AC.

Responsibility and Internal Audit Practices The Board has the ultimate accountability and authority in the effectiveness and adequacy of the internal control environment of the Group. The Board, through the AC, conducts review of the effectiveness and adequacy of internal control management. The IA operates as an independent review unit to provide objective assurance to the AC that a sound internal control system is in place and maintained.
By adopting the risk management-based approach, the IA makes reference to the globally recognized framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and employs an entity level business model to help identify a variety of risks from external and internal sources and creates a risk matrix which links risks with business objectives. Based on this result, IA develops a three-year internal audit plan (the "Plan") covering the period from 2009 to 2012 and individual audit assignment is carried out according to the Plan. Both the risk matrix and the Plan are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis by the IA and are reviewed and agreed by the AC.
In addition to the agreed schedule of audit assignments set out in the Plan, the IA also conducts ad-hoc reviews on areas of concern identified by the management and the AC. To effectively discharge its responsibilities, the IA has unrestricted access to all records, properties, functions, co-operation from management and staff of the Group, and is independent of the activities it audits. IA has adopted the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of Internal Auditors and has incorporated these standards into IA's audit practices.
Internal audit reports are issued to the AC and the executive directors to highlight the types and the nature of relevant risks within each business function and recommend actions to be taken to minimize the risks identified with the aim at promoting continuous improvement to the Group's operations. The reports on any material non-compliance and internal control weakness have been presented to and reviewed by the AC and operational management quarterly in the financial year under review. All reports will be followed up by the IA to ensure that reported weaknesses have been satisfactorily resolved. All reports are also made available to the external auditors. If required, the AC will make recommendations to the Board and monitor the implementation of any improvements in the internal control system.

18 Corporate Governance Report

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

The external auditors carry out in the course of their statutory audit an annual review of the Company's accounting controls to the extent of their scope as laid out in their audit plan. Material internal accounting control weaknesses noted during their audit are reported to the AC.

Conclusion The Board is of the view that the Group currently has adequate internal control systems in place during the financial year under review to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that there are no material loss or financial mis-statement, assets are safeguarded, proper accounting records are maintained, and financial information used within the business and for publication is reliable.

INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS The Company has adopted an internal policy in respect of any transactions with interested persons and has set out the procedures for review and approval of the interested person transactions entered into by the Group. In accordance with Rule 907 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST, details of the interested person transactions entered into by the Group with IDTI Group for the year ended March 31, 2010 are disclosed below:

COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS Principle 10: Accountability

Principle 14: Communication with shareholders

The Board has embraced openness and transparency in the conduct of the Company's affairs. The Board provides the shareholders with a detailed and balanced explanation and analysis of the Group's performance, position and prospects on a quarterly basis.

DEALINGS IN THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES In line with Listing Rule 1207(18) of the SGX-ST, the Company has adopted and implemented its own internal compliance code on dealing in securities by directors and officers of the Group. Pursuant to this code, directors and key executives of

the Group who are likely to be privy to unpublished price-sensitive and confidential information are not permitted to deal in the Company's securities during the period commencing one month immediately before the announcement of the Group's financial results and ending on the date of the announcement of such results. In addition, directors and officers are expected to observe insider trading laws at all times even when dealing in securities within the permitted trading period. The directors and officers are also discouraged from dealing in the Company's securities for shortterm consideration. The Company has introduced procedures to monitor its compliance.

Independent Auditors' Report 21

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF IDT HOLDINGS (SINGAPORE) LIMITED We have audited the accompanying financial statements of IDT Holdings (Singapore) Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (the "Group") which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and of the Company as at March 31, 2010, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows of the Group and the statement of changes in equity of the Company for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, as set out on pages 22 to 53.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, Cap. 50 (the "Act") and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibility includes: devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair profit and loss account and balance sheet and to maintain accountability of assets; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's presentation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made

by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion,
a) the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards so as to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the Company as at March 31, 2010 and of the results, changes in equity and cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date; and
b) the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
1 GENERAL The Company (Registration No. 199600219E) is incorporated in Singapore with its principal place of business at Block C, 9/F Kaiser Estate Phase 1, 41 Man Yue Street, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong and registered office at 3 Anson Road, #27-01 Springleaf Tower, Singapore 079909. The Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited. The financial statements are expressed in Hong Kong dollars.
The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment holding company.
The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 11 to the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on June 8, 2010.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF ACCOUNTING ­ The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below, and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards ("FRS").
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS ­ In the current financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised FRSs and Interpretations of FRS ("INT FRS") that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2009. The adoption of these new/revised FRSs and INT FRSs does not result in changes to the Group's and Company's accounting policies and has no material effect on the amounts reported for the current or prior years except as disclosed below.

FRS 1 ­ Presentation of Financial Statements (Revised) FRS 1 (2008) has introduced terminology changes (including revised titles for the financial statements) and changes in the format and content of the financial statements. In addition, the revised standard requires the presentation of a third statement of financial position at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented if the entity applies new accounting policies retrospectively or makes retrospective restatements or reclassifies items in the financial statements.

FRS 108 ­ Operating Segments The Group adopted FRS 108 with effect from January 1, 2009. FRS 108 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. In contrast, the predecessor standard (FRS 14 Segment Reporting) required an entity to identify two sets of segments (Business and Geographical), using a risks and rewards approach, with the entity's `system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel' serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following FRSs, INT FRSs and amendments to FRS that are relevant to the Group and the Company were issued but not effective.

·

FRS 27 (Revised) Consolidated and

Separate Financial Statements; and FRS

103 (Revised) Business Combinations

·

Improvements to Financial Reporting

Standards (issued in June 2009)

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) FRS 27 (Revised) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements; and FRS 103 (Revised) Business Combinations FRS 27 (Revised) is effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2009. FRS 103 (Revised) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 2009.
Apart from matters of presentation, the principal amendments to FRS 27 that will impact the Group concern the accounting treatment for transactions that result in changes in a parent's interest in a subsidiary. It is likely that these amendments will significantly affect the accounting for such transactions in future accounting periods, but the extent of such impact will depend on the detail of the transactions, which cannot be anticipated. The changes will be adopted prospectively for transactions after the date of adoption of the revised standard and, therefore, no restatements will be required in respect of transactions prior to the date of adoption.
Similarly, FRS 103 is concerned with accounting for business combination transactions. The changes to the Standard are significant, but their impact can only be determined once the detail of future business combination transactions is known. The amendments to FRS 103 will be adopted prospectively for transactions after the date of adoption of the revised Standard and, therefore, no restatements will be required in respect of transactions prior to the date of adoption.
Amendments to FRS 7 Statement of Cash Flows The amendments (part of Improvements to FRSs issued in June 2009) specify that only expenditures that result in a recognised asset in the statement of financial position can be classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Consequently, cash flows in respect of development costs that do not meet the criteria in FRS 38 Intangible Assets for capitalisation as part of an internally generated intangible asset (and, therefore, are recognised in profit or loss as incurred) will be reclassified from investing to operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The amendments to FRS 7 will be adopted for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010.

27
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
Management anticipates that the adoption of the above FRSs, INT FRSs and amendments to FRS in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company in the period of their initial adoption.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION ­ The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies used in line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination (see below) and the minority's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority's interest in the subsidiary's equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover its share of those losses.

28 Notes to the Financial Statements
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) In the Company's financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment in net recoverable value that has been recognised in profit or loss.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ­ The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under FRS 103 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with FRS 105 Non-Current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority's proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ­ Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.

Financial assets Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for shortterm receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Short-term bank deposits with original maturity more than three months Short-term bank deposits comprise cash held by the Group with an original maturity of more than three months. Short term bank deposits is initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash balance comprises cash on hand and demand deposits that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been impacted. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Impairment of financial assets (Continued) The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the carrying amount of the financial asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Classification as debt or equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

29
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
Financial liabilities The Group's financial liabilities are mainly trade and other payables.
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis except for short-term payables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
INVENTORIES ­ Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ­ Plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

30 Notes to the Financial Statements

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued) Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases:

Furniture, fixtures and equipment Plant and machinery Motor vehicles

­ 10% to 25% ­ 10% to 20% ­ 12% to 20%

Depreciation is not provided on construction in progress.

Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.

The estimated useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ­ Expenditure on research activities are recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated:

·

the technical feasibility of completing the intangible

asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

·

the intention to complete the intangible asset and

use or sell it;

·

the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

·

how the intangible asset will generate probable

future economic benefits;

·

the availability of adequate technical, financial and

other resources to complete the development and to

use or sell the intangible asset; and

·

the ability to measure reliably the expenditure

attributable to the intangible asset during its

development.

The amount initially recognised for internallygenerated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internallygenerated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is charged to profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.
Other development expenditures are recognised as expense as incurred. Development costs that have been capitalised as intangible assets are amortised from the commencement of the commercial production on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefits, which normally does not exceed 2 years. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS ­ At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their presented value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS (Continued) Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cashgenerating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
LEASES ­ Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
PROVISIONS ­ Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.

31

IDT Holdings (singapore) limited ANNUAL REPORT 2010

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

REVENUE RECOGNITION ­ Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.

Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:

·

the Group has transferred to the buyer

the significant risks and rewards of

ownership of the goods;

·

the Group retains neither continuing

managerial involvement to the degree

usually associated with ownership nor

effective control over the goods sold;

·

the amount of revenue can be measured

reliably;

·

it is probable that the economic benefits

associated with the transaction will flow

to the Group; and

·

the costs incurred or to be incurred

in respect of the transaction can be

measured reliably.

Revenue from rendering of services that are of short duration is recognised when the services are completed.

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.

32 Notes to the Financial Statements
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) REVENUE RECOGNITION (Continued) Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment have been established.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS ­ Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group's obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENT ­ Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.
INCOME TAX ­ Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or tax deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in the countries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates (and tax laws) that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION ­ The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are presented in Hong Kong dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION (Continued) In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary items are included in profit or loss.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations (including comparatives) are expressed in Hong Kong dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised as other comprehensive income and transferred to the Group's translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 above, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

33
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are as follows:
a) Impairment of plant and equipment The carrying amounts of the plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Management has assessed that there has been no impairment loss. The carrying amounts of property and equipment are disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements.
b) Depreciation The Group depreciates plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method. The estimated useful life reflects the management's estimate of the periods that the Group intends to derive future economic benefits from the use of the Group's plant and equipment.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (Continued) c) Impairment of development cost During the reporting period, management reconsidered the recoverability of the Group's development cost, which is included in its statements of financial position as at March 31, 2010 at HK$8.8 million (2009: HK$11.1 million). In light of the rapid technological development and keen competition, an accelerated amortisation for irrecoverable development costs amounting to HK$2,778,000 (2009: HK$1,475,000) has been recognised in profit or loss (see Note 13). Management is of the view that the carrying amount of HK$8.8 million is fully recoverable and no further impairment is required.
d) Inventory valuation method Inventory is valued at the lower of the actual cost and market price. Market price is generally the merchandise selling price quoted in the market for similar items. The Group reviews its inventory levels and movement in inventories in order to identify slow-moving and obsolete merchandise. Where the Group has identified items of inventory with market prices lower than the carrying amounts, the Group estimates the amount of allowance for such inventory. The carrying amount of inventories and allowance for inventories are disclosed in Note 10 to the financial statements.
d) Allowance for trade and other receivables Allowance for doubtful receivables of the Group is based on an ongoing evaluation of the collectibility and aging of the outstanding receivables and on management's judgement. A considerable amount of judgement is required to assess the realisation of these receivables, including reviewing creditworthiness and the past collection history of each customer. If the financial condition of the customer deteriorates, resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments, an additional allowance may be required. The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are disclosed in Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements respectively. No allowance for doubtful debts was made during the current and previous financial year.

e) Income tax provision One of the Group's subsidiaries, ExactTime Limited ("Exact-Time") has lodged objections with the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (the "HK IRD") in previous years against protective assessments totalling approximately HK$57.4 million raised by the HK IRD relating to its offshore profits tax claims for the years of assessment from 1997/98 to 2004/05. Management has revisited the case during the year, and based on further tax and legal advice and evaluation of the applicable tax law, submitted a settlement proposal to the HK IRD. The Group has already made adequate provisions to reflect the proposed settlement (see Note 19 for details).

ii) Foreign exchange risk The Group's foreign currency exposures arise mainly from the exchange rate movements of the Euro, United States dollars ("USD"), Chinese Renminbi ("RMB") and the Hong Kong dollars ("HKD") which is also the functional currency of the Company and certain of its principal subsidiaries.
Substantially all of the Group's revenues are denominated in USD, Euro and HKD while most of the cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in HKD, RMB, Euro and USD.

As far as possible, the Group uses natural hedges of matching foreign currency inflows and outflows.
At the reporting date, the carrying amounts of monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective Group entities' functional currencies are as follows:

United States dollars Euro Chinese renminbi Japanese yen Singapore dollars

There is no impact to the Company.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items.
The above analysis has excluded USD denominated monetary items as HKD, the functional currency of the group entity holding these monetary items, is pegged to USD. The directors consider that the currency risk relating to USD is minimal. Also, management anticipates that the impact of fluctuation of Hong Kong dollars against Japanese yen and Singapore dollars will not have a significant impact on the Group's profit or loss.

iii) Interest rate risk The Group's primary interest rate risk relates to interest-earning assets, the details of which are disclosed in Notes 6, 7 and 8.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the end of reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period in the case of instruments that have floating rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

4 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, FINANCIAL RISKS AND CAPITAL RISKS MANAGEMENT (Continued) iii) Interest rate risk (Continued) Interest rate sensitivity (Continued) If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group's profit for the year ended March 31, 2010 would increase/decrease by HK$Nil (2009: decrease/increase by HK$524,000), excluding impact on fixed deposits. This is mainly attributable to the Group's exposure to interest rates on its interestearning trade receivable at variable rate. The effect of reasonably possible changes in interest rates on fixed deposits is considered to be insignificant.
iv) Credit risk The Group places its cash and bank deposits with reputable financial institutions. The Group has adopted stringent guidelines on extending credit terms to customers, including monitoring the process and using of related industry's practices as reference. This includes assessing and evaluating the customer's credit reliability and periodically reviewing their financial status to determine credit limits to be granted. The Group generally requires no collateral from its customers.
The maximum credit risk that the Group is exposed to is represented by the carrying amounts of its financial assets.
Credit risk associated with sales to third parties is not considered significant.
Credit risk associated with sales to related companies is considered minimal. The ultimate holding company has indicated that it will provide financial support to the related companies to enable them to settle the trade receivables due to the Group. In addition, a repayment schedule on the outstanding trade receivables has been received from the related companies and approved by the Group. The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk as approximately 55% (2009: 66%) of trade receivables are due from a related company.

37
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
v)Liquidity risk The Group maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents, and internally generated cash flows to finance their activities. The Group finances their liquidity through internally-generated cash flows.
In the management of liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management to finance the Group's operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.
The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are repayable on demand or due within 1 year.
vi) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables and payables and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively shortterm maturity of these financial instruments.
vii) Capital risk management policies and objectives The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to owners of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group and the Company have no external borrowings.
The Group's overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.

19 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (Continued) As indicated in previous financial statements, protective assessments (the "Protective Assessments") totaling approximately HK$57.4 million relating to years of assessment from 1997/98 to 2004/05 were raised by the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (the "HK IRD") on one of the Group's subsidiaries, challenging the subsidiary's claim on its position that its profits were earned offshore and not subjected to tax in Hong Kong. The subsidiary lodged objections with the HK IRD against the Protective Assessments. The HK IRD agreed to hold over the tax claimed completely provided that the subsidiary purchased tax reserve certificates or arranged a bank guarantee. The Group purchased tax reserve certificates of HK$42.9 million ("TRC") in relation to years of assessment from 1997/98 to 2003/04 and arranged a bank guarantee of HK$3.6 million in relation to year of assessment 2004/05. The amount of TRC was included under "other receivables and prepayments" in the statement of financial position in 2009 (Note 9). The Group, with the advice from its tax advisor, has been working on an appropriate basis of settlement with the HK IRD. The management has been advised by the Group's tax advisor that, based on the subsidiary's mode of operation, the offshore claim should represent a valid case to pursue since the subsidiary's principal business was carried out outside of Hong Kong and most of its profits were derived outside Hong Kong. A tax provision of HK$10.8 million was made in the financial statements accordingly.
The Group has sought further tax and legal advice, and based on the evaluation of the applicable tax law, the Group has caused the subsidiary via the tax advisor to submit a settlement proposal to the HK IRD, with a view to settle the tax assessment dispute. The proposal is currently considered by the HK IRD.
In the proposal, whilst the subsidiary maintained that its profits are earned offshore and not subject to tax in Hong Kong, for settlement purposes, it agrees to treat 50% of its operating profits of HK$348 million, in total for the years of assessment 1997/98 to 2008/09, as profits arising in/derived from Hong Kong and hence chargeable to profits tax in Hong Kong. The Group has provided adequate provision to reflect the proposed settlement.

49
FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2010
The Company is not a tax resident in Singapore under the Singapore Income Tax Act (Chapter 134) on the basis that control and management of its business is not exercised in Singapore. Its operations are carried out wholly outside Singapore. As such, it has no Singapore-sourced income. It did not remit nor is deemed to have remitted any foreign-sourced income into Singapore for the financial year ended March 31, 2010. Accordingly, there is no income tax payable in Singapore.
During the year, the Group received additional assessments totaling HK$9.2 million (S$1.64 million) relating to year of assessment 2003, 2005 and 2006 raised by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore ("IRAS") to the Company in relation to its share buy-backs made in previous years. The Company has lodged an objection against the additional assessments on the grounds that in substance, the Company does not meet the operations/ business test of the income tax rules. The Company is awaiting the response from IRAS on the lodged objection. Notwithstanding the objection, the said tax of HK$9.2 million was paid to IRAS in January 2010 and recognised as income tax expense in profit or loss.
Foreign income tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The income tax expense varied from the amount of income tax expense determined by applying the Singapore income tax rate of 17% (2009: 17%) to (loss) profit before tax as a result of the following differences:
