Chairman's letter

Oliver Baring
Executive Chairman

Dear shareholders It is satisfying to look back on a busy year, in which we took decisive steps to contain costs and focus on core assets in response to the global financial crisis. The difficult but necessary decisions taken in 2008/09 set a solid basis for our development by maintaining the integrity of our assets and our cash balance.

The recovery in commodity prices and the improvement in the economic situation in Zimbabwe in 2009 allowed us to restart operations at the Freda Rebecca gold mine and to work towards the restart of operations at Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC). We believe that our strategy to grow production in Zimbabwe while continuing to invest in our most promising exploration prospects remains appropriate.
Commodity prices recovered in the second half of 2009 from the lows reached at the beginning of the year. Gold in particular continues to be regarded as an attractive investment; in recent weeks the gold price has hit record highs. Although recovery in base metals demand has been slow to materialise in the western markets, prices have increased on the back of strong Chinese economic growth. Although short-term corrections remain possible, we have confidence in the long-term strength of the base metals market and in the sustainability of demand.
February saw the first anniversary of the formation of Zimbabwe's Government of National Unity, and the local economic environment has continued to improve during the year. Our supply chain and our gold export process have been functioning normally and, while there remains some way to go to address the concerns of international financiers, there are signs that Zimbabwe is increasingly regarded as a potential destination for investment. In November 2009, the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC) approved a US$10 million debt facility for Mwana Africa's Freda Rebecca gold mine, the first such funding in Zimbabwe in recent years. Whilst earlier in the year we believed that the loan would be

forthcoming shortly, the drawdown of this facility has been delayed and remains subject to a number of conditions, including the provision by the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa (ECIC) of political risk insurance, which is itself subject to ratification of the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (BIPPA) between Zimbabwe and the Republic of South Africa. Whilst the agreement has been signed by both countries, formal ratification by the South African parliament remains outstanding.
At Freda Rebecca, we have completed the first phase of the refurbishment programme, with the first commercial gold pour since recommissioning taking place on 13th October 2009. Gold production to date has totalled 11,997 ounces. While the refurbished plant has performed well, production from the mine has been hampered by the poor availability and reliability of our mining fleet, and ramp up has therefore been slower than expected. We have consequently taken steps to bolster the mine fleet, and we are confident that phase I of the project will deliver its target annual production rate of 30,000 ounces of gold. Drawdown of the IDC loan described above will allow us to proceed with the second phase of the refurbishment programme, which is expected to increase production to 50,000 ounces of gold per year.
We are completing our plans for a phased re-start of operations at BNC. As the only integrated nickel mine, smelter and refinery complex in southern Africa, BNC has the potential to become a processing centre for materials produced throughout the

region. Our plans to restart mining at Trojan and the production and sale of 7,000 tonnes per year of nickel in concentrate are at an advanced stage. SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd is preparing a Competent Persons Report on the restart plans and this report is nearing completion. The ongoing care and maintenance programme has preserved the opportunity to resume smelting and refining operations once sufficient material is available to justify their restart. We are now evaluating the strategic and financing options available to the group.
Our gold exploration programme at Zani-Kodo in the DRC has confirmed the significant potential of the prospect. During the year, we announced the definition of further resources, which now total 638,290 ounces of gold, and we expect to announce a further resource update during July 2010. A further 23,000 metres of drilling is planned for the year ahead, designed to increase substantially the resources defined to date. At the SEMHKAT base metals exploration concessions in the DRC we are reviewing our exploration strategy, and considering opportunities to bring in joint venture partners.
The company's results for the year reflect the continued period of care and maintenance at BNC and the ramp up of operations at Freda Rebecca. Revenue of £18.8 million arose from sales of gold from Freda Rebecca in the second half of the year, diamonds from the Klipspringer mine and of in-process inventories at BNC. Reduced operating costs at BNC during the period of care and maintenance were offset by increased costs at Freda Rebecca as the plant ramped up its rate of production. The company invested £2.0 million in fixed assets, principally on the refurbishment programme at Freda Rebecca, and £4.0 million in its portfolio of exploration properties.
Zimbabwe remains a challenging country in which to finance projects, but we believe that the quality of our assets and the experience of our team will ensure that our projects are

returned to profitable production in the shortest possible timeframe. In March 2010, we completed a placing of 88,340,540 ordinary shares, raising approximately £8.4 million after fees and expenses. At 31st March 2010, Mwana Africa (excluding BNC) held cash of £10.4 million.
Our enthusiastic and competent team has worked extremely hard through what has been a demanding year. During the period, I was delighted with the appointments of James Arthur as Executive Vice President Operations in July 2009 and of Donald McAlister as Finance Director in September 2009. Both have brought Mwana Africa a wealth of experience and the highest level of expertise in mining in general, and in Africa in particular. In addition, we have taken steps to strengthen and deepen the on-site management teams at our operations, commensurate with the increase in activity following the return to production at Freda Rebecca and the plans to resume production at BNC.
As well as our team, I would like to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support and confidence in the company and to reaffirm our full commitment to building a truly pan-African mining group.

Chief Executive's review

Kalaa Mpinga
Chief Executive Officer

Despite the obvious effects of continuing market turbulence, the year for Mwana Africa has been defined by the resumption of operations at Freda Rebecca and the development of plans to resume operations at BNC.

I am pleased to be able to look ahead to the coming year, in which we intend to recommence production at BNC and increase gold production from Freda Rebecca. In addition, I look forward to further encouraging results from our exploration portfolio, in particular the Zani-Kodo gold prospect in the DRC.
Freda Rebecca
In March 2009, we announced that we would undertake a two-phase refurbishment programme at the mine, with a targeted commissioning date for the first phase of the project in September 2009. The plant achieved its first commercial pour of gold following completion of phase one of the refurbishment programme on 13th October 2009.
The revised export procedures for gold producers announced by the Zimbabwean government in February 2009 are working well. On average we receive cash for our gold sales 19 days after dispatch of gold dore to the Chamber of Mines.
Despite some start-up problems the plant has performed well. The mine was restarted with relatively limited capital expenditure and although initial production was in line with the company's plans, the refurbished mine fleet has been stretched as a result of low reliability, and hence availability, as we have sought to increase the production of ore from underground. This has had an adverse impact on tonnage, grade and consequently gold production. We remain confident in the quality of the orebody and the plant, and we have moved quickly to address the capacity constraints at the mine. Two additional B30D articulated dump trucks, ordered in April 2010, are due to arrive on site shortly. We are also investigating the potential to supplement the mine fleet with rental units as required. We now look forward to a return to production in line

with the planned 30,000 ounces of gold per year from phase 1. We continue to work with the IDC to satisfy the remaining conditions to drawdown on the US$10m facility approved in November 2009. Further detail on these conditions is provided in the Financial review section on page 17. The facility, when available, will allow us to implement the second phase of the refurbishment programme, which is planned to increase output to approximately 50,000 ounces of gold per year.
Production from recommissioning to date has totalled 11,997 ounces, achieving average revenue of US$1,118 per ounce.
Bindura Nickel Corporation
BNC's mines, smelter and refinery remain on care and maintenance. The programme is designed to preserve the condition of the existing infrastructure, in order to reduce the cost and risk of resuming operations. The programme includes continued pumping at the mines, periodic test runs of key equipment and ongoing monitoring of major plant structures.
BNC has prepared detailed plans for the resumption of operations at the Trojan mine and concentrator, to produce concentrates for export to third parties for further processing. Based on these plans, BNC's team has commenced preparatory work in a number of areas which lie on the critical path to the resumption of production, but where only limited expenditure is required. Further plans have been drawn up to restart and enhance the efficiency of BNC's other mines, smelter and refining assets. In addition, the company continues to assess the potential to develop the Hunters Road project.
Independent engineering consultants SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd have been appointed to review the Trojan restart project, which

We remain confident that BNC will be brought back into successful production and will return to being an important contributor to Mwana Africa

envisages production of up to 7,000 tonnes of nickel in concentrate per year. The planned programme envisages relatively limited capital expenditure, given the extent of the existing infrastructure, and a relatively short period until the intended start of commercial production. In parallel with the restart of the Trojan operation, BNC intends to conduct a recapitalisation and restructuring process, including a reduction in staffing levels, in particular at those assets which will remain on care and maintenance. While we consider that these processes are essential to enable the restart and to ensure a sustainable future for the company, we are of course aware of the impact this process will have on the individuals concerned, and will seek to mitigate these impacts where possible.
The focus of our attention has now turned to the financing of the project, and BNC has commenced discussions with offtakers and potential financiers, including Mwana Africa itself. We remain confident that BNC will be brought back into successful production, and will return to being an important contributor to Mwana Africa and the Zimbabwean economy.
Klipspringer
Klipspringer has begun to benefit from a strong recovery in the international price for diamonds, however exceptionally high rainfall hindered production during the last quarter of the year. Conditions have subsequently improved, with a consequent increase in the rate of production. 28,319 carats were sold during the year.
Exploration
In the DRC we have resumed exploration at the Zani-Kodo gold project, located in the highly prospective Ituri region. In February 2010 we announced the definition of a further 186,414 ounces at Zani-Kodo, bringing indicated mineral resources at the Zani-Kodo prospect to 217,277 ounces of gold and inferred resources to 421,013 ounces. The planned exploration programme aims to build on this success. At SEMHKAT, exploration activities were scaled back in 2008

following the collapse in commodity prices. Advisors have been appointed to evaluate interest in the prospect from potential joint venture partners.
Zimbabwe
During February 2010, new regulations concerning indigenisation and economic empowerment were published by the government of Zimbabwe. These regulations included a statement that the government would endeavour to procure that at least 51% of the shares of all companies with a market capitalisation over US$500,000 is held by indigenous Zimbabweans.
Of the business sectors in Zimbabwe, mining is unique in the scale of its need for capital investment and its potential to contribute significantly to the country's economic recovery. The Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe, of which BNC and Freda Rebecca are members, is in discussions with government regarding the application of the regulations to the mining sector. In previous years, we have taken steps towards indigenous economic empowerment at both BNC and Freda Rebecca, including BNC's listing on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, and our commitment to sell a 15% stake in Freda Rebecca to a local partner.
We are confident that, across the country, solutions will be found that balance both the need to attract investment to Zimbabwe and the responsibility of the mining industry to support the economic development of the whole country.
Human resources
I would like to add my thanks to those of our chairman to our hard working team, our shareholders, and not least to the local communities who have supported Mwana Africa's operations over the past year, and who play a key role in the company's future.

Base metals ­ nickel operations
Bindura Nickel Corporation ­ Zimbabwe Situated near the town of Bindura, 90 kilometres north-east of Harare, BNC is the only integrated nickel mine, smelter and refinery operation in Africa. Historically, ore from the company's Shangani and Trojan mines, with a combined hoisting capacity in excess of two million tonnes of ore per year, was concentrated and fed, along with concentrate from third parties, to BNC's smelter and refinery. BNC has approximately 2,400 employees and is listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. Mwana Africa acquired its 52.9% stake in the company in 2003. The mines, smelter and refinery remained on care and maintenance during the year.

The care and maintenance programme continues to preserve the integrity of the underground operations, surface concentrators and the smelter and refinery complex. Clearly defined procedures have been put in place across the operation, and special attention has been given to minimising the risk of damage to the integrity of the smelter, building on experience and protocols developed during the previous furnace shutdown.
Trojan restart BNC has developed plans for the restart of production from the Trojan mine and concentrator, including completion of the existing shaft deepening project, enhancement of existing mine infrastructure and refurbishment of existing, and purchase of new, vehicles in the mining fleet. The mine plan indicates an

improvement in grade over the modelling period, as a result of the increased contribution over time of the massives orebody ­ a zone of high-grade mineralisation on the footwall of the main orebody. This improvement in grade results in an increase in expected contained nickel in concentrate to in excess of 7,000 tonnes per year.
The plan to resume operations at the Trojan mine and concentrator is being reviewed by SRK Consulting (UK) Limited. A limited amount of pre-start work has been conducted during the care and maintenance programme. This work has targeted the refurbishment of underground plant and equipment and the overhaul of surface crushing and conveying systems, and will enable production to restart rapidly when finance is available.

The resource statement for the Trojan mine reflects the portion of the resource assessed by SRK Consulting (UK) Limited as part of their review of the Trojan restart plan. Previous resource statements included mineralisation below 37 level, which has not been reviewed by SRK. Drilling from 35 level has commenced with the aim of improving confidence on the resource information below 37 level and upgrading the current internal resource evaluation to JORC/SAMREC compliance. The programme comprises of 18 holes totalling approximately 9,000 metres of drilling.
At Shangani, resources have been reallocated into different categories from previous statements. The indicated resource at Hunters Road reflects inclusion of the East orebody, which has been drilled out but for which no mine plan or pit design has been prepared. Hunters Road West orebody excludes the first 30 metres of untreatable oxide ore mineralisation.

Base metals ­ exploration
Mwana Africa holds a 100% interest in SEMHKAT which has exploration concessions covering 4,845 square kilometres in the south-east of the DRC. Exploration is focusing on sediment-hosted stratiform copper-cobalt, iron oxide copper gold (IOCGs) occurrences as well as on showings of lead and zinc. Mwana Africa is also conducting exploration under a joint venture agreement with Ambase Exploration Africa, a subsidiary of Anglo American, over 476 square kilometres of the concession. Mwana Africa holds an 85% interest in further exploration rights over 6,395 square kilometres of prospective ground in the western Katanga and eastern Kasai Oriental provinces of the DRC (Maniamuna).

Following the decline in commodity prices in 2009, exploration during the year was directed towards low cost regional mapping and geochemical soil sampling programmes on the Mukema, Kiamato, Kibolwe and Kawesitu licences. At the end of the field season a limited core drilling programme was undertaken on the Kibolwe West and Kiamato West Copper soil anomaly.
Base metals prices have subsequently improved, and Mwana Africa has outlined a 11,000-metre drilling programme for 2010/11. Mwana is in the process of identifying additional joint venture partners with whom to explore the above concessions.
Kibolwe
The Kibolwe prospect, 160 kilometres north-west of Lubumbashi, is a significant secondary enriched sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposit hosted by Mines sub-group rocks. Reverse Circulation (RC) and core drilling programmes have outlined a near-surface, flat-lying mineralised zone up to 40 metres thick extending over a strike of 1,500 metres.

Core drilling programmes undertaken at the end of 2009 confirm that the mineralisation west of the Kibolwe Main copper clearing is open-ended. Holes drilled to the west of the main resource intersected encouraging copper grades. Further drilling programmes have been planned to test the western extensions of the deposit.
Kiamato
A sediment-hosted stratiform copper-cobalt occurrence has been identified at Kiamato, four kilometres north-west of Kibolwe. Mineralisation occurs within a 700-metre strike length of Mines sub-group strata.
Kiamato West
The prospect encompasses a 16-kilometre long and 500-metre wide copper soil anomaly (Cu 260-570ppm) with several gossan occurences. Core drilling has intersected several zones with copper mineralisation in the form of disseminated chalcopyrite.

Mwombe
Exploration on the Mwombe prospect has identified mineralised Mines sub-group strata outcropping over a 600-metre strike length. Assay results from trench and pit sampling programmes have yielded elevated nickel and cobalt concentrations as well as gold, platinum and palladium. A 1,700-metre core drilling programme was completed in the third quarter of 2008 having intersected several encouraging mineralised units.
Mukema
The early-stage Mukema prospect has breccia-hosted copper-silver mineralisation developed within Kundelungu sediments. The breccia contains malachite, chalcopyrite and chalcocite along a 700-metre strike length and has been subjected to iron metasomatism with the formation of magnetite and hematite. In places the mineralised breccia is 40 metres wide and coincides with a four-kilometre long thrust fault highlighted by aeromagnetic and radiometric data. Pit sampling of the breccia has yielded elevated levels of copper, gold and silver.
Maniamuna concessions (Kasai)
Regional geochemical soil sampling programmes have been designed to follow up observed anomalies at Kafakumba, a

sediment hosted copper target, and Lulua, a magmatic nickel copper-sulphide target in the south of the Maniamuna concession area.
Anglo American Joint Venture
The airborne electromagnetic (SPECTREM) survey, completed in 2008 over the North West Block and Lombe, identified several significant exploration targets. Mapping and geochemical soil sampling programmes were completed over five targets some of which reported elevated copper and nickel values. Rotary Air Blast and air core drilling programmes have been planned to test some of these targets.
Ambase has undertaken further exploration over the Lombe permit identifying additional zinc and copper soil anomalies and mineralised strata. Ambase completed a 1,100-metre drilling programme at Lombe where one intersection gave 26% zinc and 15% copper over 2.45 metres. Regional geochemical soil sampling programmes were continued over the north-west concessions.

Precious metals ­ operations
Freda Rebecca ­ Zimbabwe The Freda Rebecca mine, situated in the town of Bindura, was acquired by Mwana Africa in April 2005. The mine was returned to production in October 2009 following an extended period of care and maintenance.

Mwana Africa announced in March 2009 its intention to restart production at the Freda Rebecca gold mine in Zimbabwe, and has committed to sell a 15% stake to a local investor. A programme of dewatering of the underground mining areas, together with the rehabilitation of underground trackless equipment, was successfully completed during the year. In addition, the first phase of a two-phase refurbishment programme at the processing plant was concluded. The first commercial pour of gold following completion of phase one of the recommissioning programme took place on 13th October 2009. During the year, 8,550 ounces of gold were produced, realising average sales proceeds of US$1,116 per ounce.

The milling, leaching and gold winning circuits have demonstrated their ability to meet the projected throughput requirements for phase 1. However, poor reliability, and hence availability of the underground vehicle fleet, resulted in under production of ore from the mine. In order to make use of spare plant capacity, material from lower grade surface stockpiles has been processed. This has resulted in a lowering of the overall average feed grade achieved. Steps have been taken subsequently to increase the fleet capacity, including the purchase of two additional B30D articulated dump trucks.

Precious metals ­ exploration
Zani-Kodo ­ DRC Mwana Africa has a joint venture with the state-owned Office des Mines d'Or de Kilomoto (OKIMO) for gold exploration in the Ituri district of the DRC. The joint venture, in which OKIMO has a 20% free carried interest, covers gold mining rights over 1,605 square kilometres in Orientale Province, containing a series of highly prospective greenstone belts of Kibalian age which are considered to have the potential to host world-class gold deposits in excess of one million ounces. Initial results from Zani-Kodo indicate potential for a significant gold deposit, a portion of which is likely to be suitable for open-pit mining.

Diamond drilling during the year was focused on defining the down dip extension of the previously identified high-grade Kodo Main zone and was structured in two phases. The first phase involved a total of nine holes for 2,550 metres, and was completed in February 2010. The second phase involves drilling a further 21 holes for 7,000 metres.
The drilling programme has proved the downdip continuity of the Kodo Main zone to a depth of 380 metres. Initial results from phase two drilling have confirmed the downdip continuity of the north-east plunging lenticular mineralised

zone, the tight margins of the mineralisation and a shallowing of the zone. The mineralised zone remains open at depth.
Following completion of the first phase of the drilling programme, an updated resource statement for Kodo was prepared. This represented an overall increase of 41.3% in contained metal compared with the 2009 resource. In addition, the gold resource grade increased by 4%. The resource statement will be updated following analysis of the results of the second phase of the drilling programme.

Review of operations and exploration
(continued)

Diamonds ­ operations
Klipspringer ­ South Africa The Klipspringer diamond mine is situated approximately 250 kilometres north of Johannesburg. Following a period of inactivity, caused principally by the strength of the South African rand, a decision was taken to reopen the mine in December 2007. Mwana Africa acquired its stake of approximately 62% through its purchase of SouthernEra in 2007.

Production during the first nine months of the year exceeded expectations. However, higher than average rainfall during the last quarter led to an ingress of groundwater into working stopes. This made working conditions difficult, and consequently work on certain stopes was stopped temporarily. Operating conditions have improved with a reduction in rainfall in the region.

A total of 28,319 carats were sold during the year. A recovery in the price achieved for diamonds, from US$75 per carat in the May 2009 sale to US$103 per carat in February 2010, was offset in part by the continuing strength of the South African rand, in which a significant portion of Klipspringer's costs are denominated. During the year, Klipspringer submitted its application for the conversion to new mining order mining rights to the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR).

Other income includes investment income and dividends received, interest income and expense, taxation and impairment charges where appropriate.

The group reported turnover for the period of £18.8 million (2009: £28.3 million) and a net loss for the year of £14.4 million (2009: £210.6 million).

Bindura Nickel Corporation
Revenue of £11.8 million (2009: £26.2 million) was generated principally through sales of in-process inventories. Operating costs of £16.6 million (2009: £54.1 million before impairment) were reduced from the previous year because of the move to care and maintenance, and as a result of lower foreign exchange losses following the US dollarisation of the Zimbabwe economy. BNC reported a net loss of £4.8 million (2009: £32.8 million before impairment).
Freda Rebecca
During the year, Freda Rebecca was returned to production. Gold sales of 8,550 ounces, at an average of US$1,116 per ounce,

generated revenue of £6.0 million (2009: nil), including by-product sales and net of royalties and marketing costs. Operating costs during the period increased in line with the ramp up of operations, and totalled £9.7 million (2009: £0.5 million) for the year.
Other Mwana Africa group
Other revenue of £1.0 million (2009: £2.1 million) was generated by the group, principally the Klipspringer diamond mine. The company, excluding BNC and Freda Rebecca, incurred operating costs of £8.6 million (2009: £9.5 million).

(continued)

Cash flow statement (continued)
Bindura Nickel Corporation
BNC has initiated a financial plan to realise value from working capital and investments while on care and maintenance. Implementation of the plan, and receipt of cash from debtors, was offset by partial repayments to creditors and the costs of the care and maintenance programme. Net working capital movements resulted in the release of £2.8 million (2009: £14.9 million) including the sale of listed equities held by BNC. BNC's net cash position rose from £2.4 million to £4.7 million at the year end.
Freda Rebecca
Further capital expenditure of £2.2 million (2009: £0.2 million) was incurred on the first phase of the refurbishment programme

at Freda Rebecca. Working capital movements, including loans advanced to Freda Rebecca by Mwana Africa PLC, resulted in a cash inflow of £6.8 million (2009: £0.2 million).
Other Mwana Africa group
Mwana Africa (excluding BNC and Freda) saw a non-GAAP operating cash outflow (as defined in the notes to the proforma cash reconciliation) of £7.2 million (2009: £2.4 million). During the year, Mwana Africa invested £4.0 million (2009: £14.3 million) in its portfolio of exploration prospects.
During the period, the company issued 88.3 million shares, raising £8.4 million net of costs. £1.4 million of the proceeds of the placing was received subsequent to the year end, and is shown as a receivable in the group's accounts.

Non-current liabilities at Freda Rebecca includes intercompany loans owed to other subsidiaries of Mwana Africa PLC. The corresponding receivable is shown as a negative non-current liability in Mwana Africa (ex BNC).

At 31 March 2010, the group had cash balances of £15.2 million (2009: £18.9 million), comprising £4.7 million (2009: £2.4 million) held by BNC and £10.4 million (2009: £16.5 million) held by other Mwana Africa group entities. The book value of shareholders' equity at the year end was £41.5 million (2009: £47.3 million).
Bindura Nickel Corporation
The value of current assets was reduced owing to conclusion of sales of various in-process inventories, certain non-critical stocks and spares, and a portion of the equity portfolio held by BNC, and settlement of an outstanding debtor balance. Current liabilities were reduced as a result of partial payments made to creditors during the year.

Freda Rebecca
Non-current assets increased to £13.2 million as a result of the continued investment in the refurbishment of the mine and plant, and the addition of environmental assets. Current assets increased as a result of the increase in debtors following the return to production, and in line with the increase in spares inventory. Creditors increased in line with the greater expenditure at the mine and in accordance with creditor payment terms, and as a result of loans advanced by Mwana Africa PLC.
Other Mwana Africa group
The value of non-current assets increased to £17.1 million as a result of additional exploration expenditure which was capitalised during the year, and as a result of the net reversal in the impairment charge recorded in relation to gold and base metal exploration prospects in the previous year.

Group liquidity
At 31 March 2010 the Group, excluding BNC, held cash of £10.4 million (2009: £16.5 million), following receipt of £7.0 million of the £8.4 million net proceeds of the March 2010 share placing. The balance of £1.4 million was received subsequent to the year end, and is shown as a receivable in the group's accounts. As at 18th June 2010 the group, excluding BNC, held cash of £5.2 million. As at 28th June 2009, Mwana Africa had 486,107,759 issued and outstanding shares (excluding own shares held in treasury), and a market capitalisation of approximately £42 million.
The group's exploration activities and other costs over the coming year would exceed current cash resources and the positive cash flow expected from Freda Rebecca, and thus require funding. The directors intend to raise funding, by debt or equity, sufficient to restart operations at Trojan, settle BNC's deferred creditors and to provide sufficient funds for the group's other activities.
IDC facility
As announced in November 2009, Freda Rebecca (a subsidiary of Mwana) has agreed terms of a US$10 million project finance facility provided by the IDC.
Formal documentation of the conditional loan facility was signed on 23rd March 2010. The board of the IDC has since approved the final terms of the facility, and the environmental management plan for the mining operations at Freda Rebecca has been completed to the IDC's satisfaction.
Drawdown of the facility remains subject to certain conditions, most notably the provision by the ECIC of political risk insurance for the facility, which is itself subject to ratification of the BIPPA between Zimbabwe and South Africa. The agreement is aimed at providing security of tenure to South African investments in Zimbabwe, and Zimbabwean investments in South Africa. The agreement was signed by the respective governments on 27th November 2009, and was ratified by the government of Zimbabwe on 11th May 2010. In South Africa, the agreement

has been adopted by the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry in the National Assembly and by the Select Committee on Trade and International Relations in the National Council of Provinces. Mwana Africa expects that, in the coming weeks, the instrument will be put forward for adoption by the South African parliament, after which notice of the agreement's ratification will complete the process.
In addition, the External Loans Coordinating Committee (ELCC) of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has approved the terms of the facility. However, ELCC has not approved the provision of certain of the ancillary arrangements, including the mortgage charge over the land on which the Freda Rebecca plant is built and the operation of offshore accounts. Mwana Africa is working with the ELCC and IDC to agree amendments to the security package, compliant with the current exchange control regulations in Zimbabwe.
Provision of the second tranche of the facility, totalling US$6 million, is subject to independent verification of JORC/SAMREC compliant measured gold resources, sufficient to support a 10-year mine life. Adequate inferred and indicated resources to support this mine life were defined by the previous owners of the mine. However, the standards of quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC) are considered insufficient to allow these resources to be classified as measured resources. A programme of re-sampling of existing drill cores is underway, and is expected to provide sufficient QA/QC to allow the resource to be upgraded to the measured category. This programme is expected to be completed during August 2010. Once drawn, the loan is repayable in 10 equal installments over a five year period and attracts interest at US$LIBOR plus 5%. Mwana Africa PLC will provide a guarantee until completion of the refurbishment programme.
Going concern
Attention is drawn to disclosure surrounding the going concern basis of preparation. Further information is provided in note 2: Basis of preparation to the financial statements on page 43.

Overview of social and environmental responsibility
20

Mwana Africa recognises that a reputation for responsible development is an integral part of its long-term success as a resources company. Mwana Africa seeks to earn this reputation by providing a safe working environment for its staff, by having a positive effect on local communities, and by minimising the environmental impact of its activities.

Workplace health and safety
Mwana Africa recognises that mining and associated operations have an inherent level of risk, and recognises its responsibility to provide a safe working environment for all of its employees.
Regretfully Mr. James Sithole, a loader operator at the Klipspringer diamond mine, was fatally injured in an underground accident on 9th March 2010. An investigation into the accident has been completed by Mwana Africa and the DMR. We extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends.
At Freda Rebecca, management has focussed on ensuring that the strong safety culture, which had been demonstrated prior to the move to care and maintenance, is retained following the resumption of operations. Similarly, BNC is putting workplace safety at the heart of its plans to restart the Trojan mine and concentrator. Before being placed on care and maintenance, BNC achieved certification to the OHSAS 18001: 1999 standard for occupational health and safety. Freda Rebecca and BNC will seek reaccreditation once the mines are fully operational.
Effect on local communities
Sustainable community development
Mwana Africa's primary contribution to the often remote areas in which it operates is the stimulation of economic activity through the creation of jobs, development and support of SMEs, the use of local contractors, the purchase of goods and services from nearby suppliers, and the development of local infrastructure. As a result, the group's impact extends well beyond its direct employees and into the communities where it operates. In Zimbabwe it has been estimated that, for every employee of BNC and Freda Rebecca, as many as ten others derive benefit; a total of more than 30,000 people.
Employment
At the year end, Mwana Africa (including BNC) employed 2,982 people, comprising 322 staff in management and administration and 2,660 operatives.
Social investment and education
The main thrust of Mwana Africa's social initiatives continues to be in education. BNC provides on-site primary school

education, funds secondary schooling and grants a number of scholarships to higher education institutions for employees' children. The BNC Chairman's Fund acts as a vehicle through which to channel its social and community development activities. Freda Rebecca is assisting pre-primary, primary and secondary schools to upgrade their teaching facilities, and with BNC, is looking into university bursaries at the local Bindura campus.
Community health
The principal health issues faced in the regions where Mwana Africa operates are malaria and HIV/AIDS. Mwana Africa provides medicines, education and training for the prevention and treatment of malaria. At Freda Rebecca, Klipspringer, and BNC, Mwana Africa has implemented a community-wide HIV/AIDS management strategy, which includes awareness campaigns, voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), and health care training and education. Freda Rebecca provides anti-retroviral medication to affected employees and their dependants.
BNC and Freda Rebecca staff and fund the running of general health clinics for employees and their families.
Minimising environmental impact
Mwana Africa seeks to limit the impact of its operations on the environment, including responsible waste disposal and prevention of pollution, optimising the use of resources such as water, fuel and electricity and conserving local biodiversity.
Mwana Africa's environmental management systems are informed by the processes and practices of ISO14001, an international benchmarking certification. BNC's ISO14001 certification, achieved in 2005, was suspended upon the move to care and maintenance. Freda Rebecca is implementing an Environmental Management Programme, prepared in accordance with the Equator Principles and the performance standards of the IFC/World Bank/World Health Organisation Guidelines.
Mwana Africa recognises its obligation to rehabilitate the sites where it has operated. Financial provisions are in place for costs associated with the closure of the company's operations in Zimbabwe and South Africa, as prescribed by local laws.

Directors' report

The directors present their report and financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Principal activities
The group's main activities are exploration, development and production of nickel, gold, copper and diamonds. Further information concerning the activities of the group and its future prospects are contained in the Chairman's letter on pages 2 and 3 and the Review of operations and exploration on pages 6 to 16.
Business review
The loss for the year attributable to shareholders of the parent company was £14.5 million (2009: £210.6 million). The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend on ordinary shares. As required by the Companies Act 2006, the company must provide a fair review of the development and performance of the group during the year ended 31 March 2010, its financial position at the end of the year and likely future developments in the group's business. The information which satisfies these requirements is to be found in the Chairman's letter on pages 2 and 3, the Chief Executive's review on pages 4 and 5, the Review of operations and exploration on pages 6 to 16, and the Financial review on pages 17 to 19.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The group's principal operating activities are based in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Companies operating in Zimbabwe are subject to adverse economic conditions common to all business activities in the country and the group is working with the relevant authorities, to the extent possible, to reduce the impact of the prevailing economic situation on its Zimbabwean operations.

The operating entities are also exposed to changes in the market prices of nickel, gold and diamonds. The group's policy with respect to hedging is not to hedge sale prices of commodities or exchange rates. Cash balances are held in both Sterling and the United States Dollar.

The group is significantly exposed to the risks inherent to all exploration activities. Management limits the group's exposure to this risk by closely monitoring the results of all exploration activities and by evaluating the feasibility of exploration prospects against changes in the relevant markets on an ongoing basis.

Key performance indicators
The group closely monitors key performance indicators against forecasts, embracing the spread of assets, operational parameters and financial indicators including cash held.

Changes in share capital
Details of changes in the share capital during the year are set out in note 26 to the financial statements.

Purchase of own shares
At the company's annual general meeting held on 15 September 2009, shareholders passed a special resolution renewing the company's authority to purchase its own shares. This authority continues to the date of the next annual general meeting or, if sooner, 15 months after the passing of the resolution.

Creditor payment policy
Each operating company in the group is responsible for agreeing the terms of transactions, including payment terms, with suppliers and, provided that suppliers perform in accordance with the agreed terms, it is the group's policy that payment is made accordingly. Trade creditors of the group at 31 March 2010 represented 369 days (2009: 159 days) of annual purchases, including capital expenditure. As reported in the Financial review on pages 17 to 19, BNC has remained on care and maintenance. The company's liquidity has consequently been severely restricted slowing payments to its creditors.

Subsequent events
The post balance sheet events are described in note 32 to the financial statements.

The policy on directors' remuneration is that the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain individuals of a quality capable of achieving the group's objectives.
The remuneration policy is designed such that individuals are remunerated on a basis that is appropriate to their position, experience and value to the company.
The Remuneration Committee determines the contract terms, basic salary and other remuneration for each of the executive directors, including performance related share options, bonuses, pension rights and any compensation payments.
Executive remuneration package
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service and employment contracts are discussed below.
Basic salary and benefits
The policy is to review salary and benefits annually against competitive market data and analysis, and adjust accordingly.
Bonus scheme
There is no formal bonus scheme in place. Bonuses paid during the year ended 31 March 2010 are set out in the Directors' remuneration report.
Share options
The company has outstanding options under an unapproved Share Option Scheme adopted in 1997, which expired in September 2007 (1997 Scheme) and a new scheme which was approved by shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on 31 July 2007 (2007 Scheme).
1997 Scheme Under the 1997 Scheme unapproved share options were granted to directors and employees by the Remuneration Committee. The company's policy on the granting of share options is to make such awards that are necessary to recruit and retain executives. Details of option awards made under this scheme and the previous option arrangements are detailed in note 30.
The company has operated this scheme since 1997 where options were granted to any employee, officer or director of the company or any subsidiary of the company. The limit for options granted under this scheme was not to exceed 15% of the number of issued ordinary shares from time to time.
The Board granted options at its discretion. The subscription price was fixed by the Board at the price per share on the dealing day preceding the date of grant.
These options vest immediately and may be exercised at any time within a seven-year period from the date of the grant, unless the Board determines otherwise. The options lapse if not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the grant. It was the Board's policy to spread the vesting period for options granted to employees over two to three years.
26

Unless the Board agrees otherwise, the right to exercise an option terminates on the holder ceasing to be a participant, subject to certain exceptions, which broadly apply in the event of death of the option holder or where the option holder ceases to be a participant due to retirement, ill health, accident or redundancy. In such a case, the option may be exercised within six months of such event provided such exercise will take place within seven years of the original date of grant.
2007 Scheme The 2007 Scheme allows for awards of both tax approved options (approved options) to be made to employees resident in the United Kingdom and unapproved options (unapproved options), to be made to both resident and non-resident employees. The company's policy on the granting of share options is to make such awards that are necessary to recruit and retain executives. Details of option awards made under this scheme are detailed in note 30.
The company has operated this scheme since December 2007 where options may be granted to full-time employees and directors of the company or any subsidiary of the company. The overall limit for options granted under this scheme and any other employees' share scheme adopted by the company is, in any rolling 10-year period, 10% of the issued share capital (including treasury shares) of the company for the time being plus 8,100,000 ordinary shares. There is an individual limit of a maximum of ordinary shares to the value of £30,000 in respect of approved options.
Options may be granted when the Remuneration Committee determines, within 42 days of the announcement by the company of its full or interim results. Options may be granted outside the 42-day period if the Remuneration Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances. Options must be granted subject to performance conditions being satisfied. The performance conditions must be objective and, save where the Remuneration Committee determines there to be exceptional circumstances, the performance conditions must relate to the overall financial performance of the company or the market value of ordinary shares over a period of at least three years. The performance conditions can be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee if it determines that a change of circumstances means that the performance conditions cannot reasonably be met. No consideration is payable on the grant of an option and no option may be granted after 31 July 2017.
The Remuneration Committee determines the exercise price before the options are granted which cannot be less than the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
The options can only be exercised on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the performance conditions have been satisfied. The options lapse if not exercised by the 10th anniversary of the grant.
These options lapse when the option holder ceases to be an eligible employee. In the case of death, a participant's personal representatives may exercise his/her options within 12 months after the date of death. Where an option holder ceases to be an employee by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, the company that employs the option holder ceasing to be a subsidiary of the company, retirement, pregnancy or in any other circumstances determined by the Remuneration Committee, the options may be exercised within six months of the termination of employment.
Share incentives
The Share Incentive Scheme was approved by shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on 31 July 2007. The Share Incentive Scheme is designed to complement the Share Option Scheme to facilitate awards to selected executives and managers. The Share Incentive Scheme permits the award of any one or a combination of the following incentives:
the sale of ordinary shares on deferred payment terms; share awards as part of a bonus scheme by way of nil cost options in consideration of cash bonuses forgone on terms that would be determined by the Remuneration Committee of the company; and the issue of share appreciation rights either by the company or EBT (as defined below).
The company has also adopted an Employees' Benefit Trust (EBT) which will operate in conjunction with the Share Option Scheme and Share Incentive Scheme. The EBT has not yet been utilised for this purpose and there have been no awards under the Share Incentive Scheme since it was approved by shareholders.

(continued)

Pensions
The company does not operate a pension scheme for executive directors but does, according to the director's preference, contribute to the personal pension plan of each executive director, or pays cash in lieu of such contributions up to a specified maximum of 12.5% of salary. No pension contributions are made in respect of non-executive directors.
Fees
The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board, having taken independent expert advice on appropriate levels, and are reviewed on an annual basis.
Service contracts
The service and employment contracts of the executive directors are not of a fixed duration and therefore have no unexpired terms, but continuation in office as a director is subject to re-election by shareholders as required under the company's Articles of Association. The company's policy is for executive directors to have service and employment contracts with provision for termination of no longer than 12 months' notice.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts. Letters of appointment provide for termination of the appointment with three months' notice by either party. Details of the current directors' contracts or appointment dates are as follows:

Statement of directors' responsibilities
To the shareholders of Mwana Africa PLC
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. On behalf of the Board: DAR McAlister Finance Director 30 June 2010
32

Statement of corporate governance
The directors support the principles of good corporate governance. While not mandatory for an AIM company, the directors have implemented, where practical for a company of this size and nature, certain provisions of the principles of good governance and code of best practices under the 2008 Combined Code. The disclosures presented herein are limited and are not intended to constitute a corporate governance statement as prescribed by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules or the Companies Act.
The Board has also considered the guidance published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales concerning the internal control requirements of the Combined Code, in line with the Turnbull Report. The Board regularly reviews key business risks, via a number of properly constituted committees, in addition to the financial risks facing the group in the operations of the business.
The Board
The Board meets at least quarterly throughout the year. The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the group's strategy, planning, budgets, major items of capital expenditure, acquisitions, risk, human resources and environmental management.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least twice during the year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the company is properly reported on and monitored, and for meeting the auditors and reviewing the auditors' reports relating to the accounts. The committee also recommends the appointment of, and reviews the fees of, the external auditors. It meets once a year with the auditors without executive Board members present. The Audit Committee comprises at least three members, two of whom shall be non-executive. The current membership of the committee is Mr SG Morris (Chairman), Dr E Denis and Mr JA Anderson.
Remuneration Committee
A Remuneration Committee meets at least twice per year. It reviews the performance of the executive directors and sets and reviews the scale, structure and basis of their remuneration and the terms of their service agreements paying due regard to the interests of shareholders as a whole and the performance of the company. The Remuneration Committee comprises the non-executive directors, Mr JA Anderson (Chairman), Mr SG Morris and Dr E Denis. The Directors' remuneration report appears on pages 26 to 31.
Internal controls
The directors have overall responsibility for the group's internal control and effectiveness in safeguarding the assets of the group. Internal control systems are designed to reflect the particular type of business, operations and safety risks and to identify and manage risks, but not entirely all risks to which the business is exposed. As a result, internal controls can only provide a reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatements or loss.
The processes used by the Board to review the effectiveness of the internal controls are through the Audit Committee and the executive management reporting to the Board on a regular basis where business plans, budgets and authorisation limits for the approval of significant expenditure, including investments are appraised and agreed. The Board also seeks to ensure that there is a proper organisational and management structure with clear responsibilities and accountability.
It is the Board's policy to ensure that the management structure and the quality and integrity of the personnel are compatible with the requirements of the group.
As a 52.9%-owned subsidiary, BNC is wholly consolidated into the Group's accounts. In recent years BNC's financial results have been distorted by a combination of hyperinflation, rapid currency devaluation and the effect of foreign exchange regulations. BNC has continued to suffer from a loss of people and skills, with a consequent deterioration in the control environment and the quality of information provided. Similar issues have affected processes at Freda Rebecca, exacerbated by the operation's extended period of care and maintenance, and at our now limited exploration activities in the DRC and Ghana. Mwana has therefore sought to implement controls and information processes at a group level in order to reduce the risk associated with these operations.

Independent auditors' report to the members of Mwana Africa PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Mwana Africa PLC for the year ended 31 March 2010, set out on pages 35 to 75. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 32, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's (APB's) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB's web-site at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/UKP.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 March 2010 and of the group's loss for the year then ended; the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Emphasis of matter ­ going concern
In determining the form of our opinion on the financial statements, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 2 to the financial statements concerning the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern. In particular, the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the group's ability to effect suitable financial and other arrangements to reopen its Zimbabwean nickel mine, on which the group's and company's viability is dependant, to settle deferred creditors and to meet ongoing operational and exploration expenditures. As disclosed in note 2, this is subject to uncertainties linked to the current reliance on creditor deferral, the availability of funding, commodity market conditions and the political and economic situation in Zimbabwe. These conditions, along with other matters explained in note 2 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the group and company were unable to continue as a going concern.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2010
1. Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union
The consolidated financial statements of the parent company (the company) and its subsidiaries (together, the group) and the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
With the exception of certain items noted below, which are carried at fair value, the financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The company and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company has elected not to present its own income statement.
Going concern
The directors consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010 having considered current trading, the current funding position, and the projected funding requirements of the group for at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2010 the group has recommenced operations at the Freda Rebecca gold mine as phase I of its plans and has maintained its exploration activities at Zani-Kodo and SEMHKAT.
The global financial crisis in 2008 and the economic situation in Zimbabwe forced the directors to place BNC, the group's partly owned subsidiary in Zimbabwe, onto care and maintenance in November 2008 and these operations remain on care and maintenance.
The group reports a loss for the year ended 31 March 2010 of £14 million. As at 18 June 2010, the group held cash of £8.9 million, of which £3.8 million is held by BNC. BNC's costs whilst on care and maintenance have been largely funded from its own working capital and by the deferral of significant amounts which remain due on demand to creditors. The group's other activities have been funded by its cash resources which were augmented by an equity fund raising of £8.8 million at the end of March 2010. The group has no bank borrowings and a US$10 million loan facility for the Freda Rebecca phase II expansion which remains undrawn, pending fulfilment of final loan conditions not all of which are within the group's control.
Whilst Freda Rebecca is projected to be cash generative over the course of the next twelve months, its cash generation, together with existing cash resources, are not of themselves sufficient to fund the group's long term cash requirements whilst BNC remains on care and maintenance. Accordingly, the group's nickel assets at BNC will need to become operational once more. The directors are planning to restart operations at BNC and settle its deferred creditors and accordingly have engaged SRK Consulting (UK) Limited to prepare a Competent Person's Report into the technical and economic viability of the restart of mining and concentrating operations at BNC's Trojan mine. The directors are confident that operations at Trojan can be restarted and operated successfully, subject to the availability of finance, based on their existing extensive and detailed knowledge of the mine, the draft report of SRK Consulting (UK) Limited and on the group's economic models using a long term nickel price assumption of 16,500 US$/t.
The directors are in discussion with a number of parties in relation to funding for BNC and have received preliminary indications from their advisors that financing for the reopening of the mine, including funds sufficient to settle the amounts due to creditors, settlement of which are currently being deferred, would be available subject to both normal due diligence requirements and market conditions. In addition the directors have taken into consideration the improved business environment in Zimbabwe, improved regulations covering the export and payment for metals, removal of foreign exchange controls and the abolition of the Zimbabwe dollar as currency of the country. There are also a number of examples of new investments into Zimbabwe in the mining sector indicating a general availability of funding.
43

Notes to the annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2010 (continued)
2. Accounting policies (continued)
The directors acknowledge that the achievement of these aims remains subject to uncertainties resulting from operational, market, and political and economic conditions in Zimbabwe, and to the availability of finance. In addition, timing of the restart of operations at BNC will depend on when new finance will be raised.
The group's other exploration activities and other costs would, during the year, exceed current cash resources and the positive cash flow expected from Freda Rebecca, and thus require funding.
The directors therefore intend to raise funding, by debt or equity, sufficient to restart operations at Trojan, settle BNC's deferred creditors and to provide sufficient funds for the group's other activities. The group could not continue beyond late 2010 without such funding.
In drawing up their projections the directors have taken into account that they have provided no guarantee or indication of financial support to BNC and note that BNC will continue to rely on the agreement of creditors to defer settlement for funding and liquidity until new finance is raised.
The directors consider that the requirement to raise new finance for both BNC and Mwana Africa in these circumstances represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the group's and company's ability to continue as a going concern. This uncertainty is linked to the current reliance of BNC on creditor deferral, future availability of funding to both BNC and Mwana Africa, market conditions and the political and economic situation in Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, they continue to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities over who's financial and operating policies the group has the ability to exercise control. The group financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries. The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Jointly controlled entities ­ Klipspringer diamond mine A joint venture is an entity in which the group holds a long-term interest and in which the group has the ability to exercise joint control in terms of a contractual arrangement. The group's interest in a jointly controlled entity is accounted for by proportionate consolidation. In terms of this method, the group includes its share of the income and expenses, assets and liabilities, and cash flows on a line by line basis with similar items in the group's financial statements.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group transactions, balances, and any unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Use of significant estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Derivation of assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable values of assets, disclosed in note 11 relating to impairment, requires a significant amount of judgement. The assumptions underlying the estimated recoverable values include, amongst others,
44

the technical performance, revenue, operating costs and discount rate (for discounted cash flow based valuations), and are based on management's best judgements at the date of signing the accounts. In particular, the challenging environment in Zimbabwe and the absence of recent production statistics has affected the quality of information, particularly in relation to historic operating costs, requiring greater use of judgment than would otherwise be the case. These judgements used by management correspond to realistic scenarios taking into account the information available. The impairment note discloses a sensitivity analysis with regard to the assumptions which the board deems most susceptible to variances against forecast.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 11 ­ Impairment Note 22 ­ Inventories Note 24 ­ Available-for-sale financial assets Note 25 ­ Assets held for sale Note 27 ­ Rehabilitation provisions Note 28 ­ Provisions and other payables Note 30 ­ Share-based payments
Intangible assets ­ exploration and evaluation expenditure
All directly related expenditure associated with mineral exploration is capitalised on a project-by-project basis, pending the determination of the feasibility of the project. Mineral exploration costs include an allocation of administration and salary costs as determined by management. If a project is ultimately successful, the related exploration costs are written off over the life of the estimated ore reserve on a unit-of-production basis. As soon as a project is not expected to be successful, whether relinquished, abandoned or uncommercial, the related exploration costs are written off.
Exploration and evaluation assets are classified as either intangible assets or as tangible assets depending upon their nature.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are not amortised until the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. Exploration and evaluation assets are specifically assessed for impairment before reclassification.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in exploration activities is capitalised to intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
Exploration and evaluation capitalised expenditures are allocated to the cash-generating units for the purpose of the impairment assessment on the basis of the exploration field in which they have been incurred.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the group's assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.
Exploration and evaluation assets are also assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i) its fair value less costs to sell and ii) its value in use, which is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or CGU, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks associated with the asset or CGU. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. It usually corresponds to the exploration field or the production unit.
45

Notes to the annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2010 (continued)
2. Accounting policies (continued)
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been de-recognised. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
The company assesses for impairment the value of its investments in and loans to its subsidiaries.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through the income statement. If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal installments over the estimated useful economic lives as set out below.
Mining assets: mining assets are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over the estimated operating life of mine based on the directors' estimate of proven and probable reserves. Smelter and refinery assets: smelter and refinery assets are depreciated at varying rates on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives, which range from five to 40 years. Plant and equipment and motor vehicles: plant and equipment and motor vehicles are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at the rate of 10% and 20% respectively. Buildings: buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives, currently 40 years.
Investments
The group's Zimbabwean investments in equity securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Subsequent to their initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. When an investment is de-recognised, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss.
The group's other investments in equity securities are recognised initially at cost with any subsequent impairments being recognised through profit or loss.
The group holds a 65% interest in the Klipspringer diamond mine joint venture, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of which are consolidated on a proportional basis.
The company has investments in its various subsidiaries. These are accounted for at cost less impairment. All inter-group investments are repayable on demand.
46

Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group entity are prepared in its functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
foreign currency monetary items are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement or re-translation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement; non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated; and exchange differences arising on the re-translation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement except for differences arising on the re-translation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in the other comprehensive income, in which case any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
The directors have prepared the financial statements on the basis of their judgement that the functional currency under IAS 21 of the group's Zimbabwean subsidiaries is the US dollar. The directors judge that the functional currency of these subsidiaries is the US dollar, based on revenue, capital expenditure and the majority of costs being denominated in US dollars.
(b) Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a group entity is different from the group's presentational currency (pounds sterling), its results, financial position and cash flows are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date; income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such an average rate does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used; and all resulting exchange differences are recognised in translation reserves as a separate component of equity and are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. Cash flows are translated using average exchange rates during the period and the effect of exchange rate changes on the balances of cash and cash equivalents is presented as part of the reconciliation of movements therein.
Rehabilitation provision
A provision is recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Estimated long-term environmental obligations, comprising pollution control, rehabilitation and mine closure, are based on the group's environmental management plans in compliance with current technology, environmental and regulatory requirements.
On initial recognition, the net present value of estimated future decommissioning costs are capitalised to property, plant and equipment and the concomitant provisions are raised. These estimates are reviewed annually and discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Any increases in such revised estimates are capitalised to property, plant and equipment while decreases in estimates are recognised by impairing the asset in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The group has not entered into any finance lease arrangements.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Employee benefits
(a) Defined contribution pension scheme Certain companies in the group operate defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds. The amounts charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
(b) Share-based payments The share option programmes allow employees to acquire shares of the company. The fair value of options granted is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option-pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where variations are due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, the weighted average purchase price is used. For finished goods and work in progress, cost is taken as production cost, which includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads. Net realisable value is calculated based on market prices prevailing as at the year-end less costs to sell. The value of work in progress is not recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position. This material is considered inaccessible to the group as its value would only be realised upon closure or disposal of the asset.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the associated deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
48

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the sale of diamonds, gold and nickel net of discounts and taxes. Revenue also includes toll refining and processing of material on behalf of, or purchased from, non-group companies. Revenue from the sale of gold is based on the spot price on date of delivery, while revenue from the sale of nickel is based on the international market price of nickel. Diamond revenue is based on negotiated prices. Revenue is only recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the purchaser.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits with an initial period to maturity of no more than three months. Cash reserves held in currencies other than sterling are subject to changes in value resulting from exchange rate fluctuations.
3. Revised and Amended Standards and Interpretations
The following revised and amended standards and interpretations, which have all been endorsed by the EU, have been adopted by the group in these consolidated financial statements; their adoption with the exception of IAS 1 (revised) has had no material impact on the group's net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial Statements, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, has resulted in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense being renamed the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the introduction of the Statement of Changes in Equity as a primary statement. The group presents in the consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in equity, whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. IAS 1 also requires an additional Balance Sheet to be presented as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period whenever an accounting policy is applied retrospectively, or a retrospective restatement of items is made in the financial statements, or items are reclassified in the financial statements. IAS 23 (Revised), Borrowing Costs, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, has removed the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale. The revised standard requires such borrowing costs to be capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. The group's previous policy in relation to borrowing costs was to realise these through profit and loss as they were incurred. Amendments to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, relate to puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation. Amendments to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and IFRIC 9, Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives, effective for accounting periods ending on or after 30 June 2009, relate to the assessment for separation of embedded derivatives on reclassification of a hybrid instrument out of the fair value through profit or loss category. Amendments to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. These amendments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, relate to the measurement of the initial cost of investment in subsidiaries in the financial statements of the company only. Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only; other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions. It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, increases the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement and reinforces existing principles for disclosure of liquidity risk. IFRS 8, Operating Segments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and sets out requirements for disclosure of information about an entity's operating segments and also about the entity's products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers. The group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the CEO, who is the group's chief operating decision maker. Comparative segment information has been re-presented in conformity with the transitional requirements of IFRS 8.

(continued)
3. Revised and Amended Standards and Interpretations (continued)
Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Reclassification of Financial Instruments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008, the amendments permit an entity to transfer from the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category a financial asset that otherwise would have met the definition of loans and receivables, if the entity has the intention and ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future. The amendments also permit an entity to reclassify non-derivative financial assets, other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition, out of the trading category in certain circumstances. IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements, which has been endorsed by the EU and which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 29 March 2009, clarifies existing requirements in relation to accounting for government sponsored infrastructure projects. IFRIC 14, IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and Their Interaction, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, clarifies when refunds or reductions in future contributions should be regarded as available, how a minimum funding requirement might affect the availability of reductions in future contributions; and when it might give rise to a liability. IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 as endorsed by the EU, deals with the accounting for customer loyalty programmes. IFRIC 16, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, which has been endorsed by the EU and which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008, clarifies which currency exposures qualify for hedge accounting; which entity within a group can hold the hedging instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; and how to determine the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item when an investment in a foreign operation is disposed of. Annual improvements to IFRSs, issued in May 2008 and effective for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations that are not yet effective
The following new, revised and amended standards and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU, but are not yet effective and therefore have not been adopted by the group in these consolidated financial statements. None of these revised and amended standards and interpretations is expected to have a material impact on the group's net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
IFRS 1 (Revised), First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, simplified the structure of IFRS 1 without making any technical changes. IFRS 3 (Revised), Business Combinations, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, harmonises business combination accounting with US GAAP. The standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently re-measured at fair value through income; goodwill and non-controlling interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis; and all transaction costs will be expensed. IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. They will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost, with any remaining interest in the entity re-measured to fair value and a gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, for Eligible Hedged Items, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, clarifies how the principles that determine whether a hedged risk or portion of cash flows is eligible for designation should be applied. Amendments to IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39, which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, relate to the assessment for separation of embedded derivatives on reclassification of a hybrid instrument out of the fair value through profit or loss category. IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, standardises accounting practice for the recognition of revenue by real estate developers for sales before construction is complete. IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, clarifies how an entity should measure distributions of assets, other than cash, when it pays dividends to its owners.
50

IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers, which is effective for transfers after 1 November 2009, clarifies the accounting for arrangements where an item of property, plant and equipment provided by the customer, is used to provide an ongoing service.
4. Financial risk management
Overview
The group has exposure to the following risks in relation to its operating and financial activities: credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk.
This note presents information about the group's exposure to each of the above risks, the group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included within note 31.
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group's risk management framework. The subsidiaries report regularly to the board of directors on their activities and their risk management procedures.
The group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the group.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group's receivables from customers.
The company's cash balances are held in investments and with institutions considered by the directors to have a low risk of default. The group's policy on credit risk is to seek, to the extent possible, to deal with customers with a strong financial position, and to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to reduce the level of counterparty credit risk. Such measures may include limiting shipments of material while balances are outstanding, requesting the use of bank and/or corporate guarantees, and, where appropriate, retention of amounts owed by the group to its counterparties by way of offset against amounts owed to the group. The group's principal customer is a substantial, reputable commodities trader.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due and is measured by reference to cash levels and forecasted cash flows. The group's approach to managing liquidity is to seek to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group's reputation. The group monitors its current and forecasted cash and cash equivalents positions to ensure that it will be able to meet its financial commitments.
During the period, BNC's cash position continued to be undermined by the cessation of production, and payment of ongoing care and maintenance costs. As a result, the company was forced to suspend payment to its creditors. BNC has implemented a plan to realise value from remaining working capital items, and will seek to reach settlement with its creditors in due course.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and commodity prices will affect the group's income. The group's earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of nickel, gold, and diamonds that it produces. The group is also exposed to movements in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents as well as the risk related to market price of the investments held. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The group's policy is not to hedge commodity price risk. Consequently, as at 31 March 2010 and during the year, the group did not have any long-term commodity price hedges in place.

4. Financial risk management (continued)
Currency risk
The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions and investments that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling, including the US dollar and the South African rand. Such risks include the effect of movements in exchange rates on the group's forecasts of capital and operating expenditure, and on the group's forecasts of revenue. The group's policy is not to hedge currency risk. Consequently, as at 31 March 2010 and during the year, the group did not have any currency hedges in place.
Capital management
The group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity. The board is committed to maintaining a capital base that maintains creditors' confidence in Mwana Africa's ability to meet its commitments. The company's primary objectives when managing its capital are:
to ensure that the company is able to operate as going concern; to have available both the necessary financial resources and the appropriate equity to allow the company to make investments including, where necessary, further investment in existing subsidiaries, that will deliver acceptable future returns to the company's shareholders; and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The board of directors monitors the return on capital using a number of metrics, including return on net assets and return on investment. There were no changes in the company's approach to capital management in the year. Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
5. Segmental information
The group has four reportable segments, as described below, which are the group's strategic business units.
The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. The CEO reviews internal management reports for each of the strategic business units. The following summary describes the operations in each of the group's reportable segments:
Gold: Gold mining and prospecting activities Nickel: Nickel mining, smelting and refining activities currently on care and maintenance Diamonds: Diamond mining activities Exploration: Gold and base metal exploration activities

All impairment charges and reversals have been booked to the income statement in 2010 and 2009.
The Board has assessed the carrying values of the group's intangible exploration assets, property, plant and equipment and equity investments for impairment as at 31 March 2010. In addition, the company's investments in, and loans to subsidiaries have been assessed for impairment as at 31 March 2010.
As a result of these assessments, an impairment charge has been recognised to reduce the carrying values of the base metals exploration CGU, and the impairment charge recognised in the previous year to reduce the carrying value of the gold exploration CGU has been reversed. No impairment or reversal of previous impairment is considered appropriate for the group's other CGUs.
Gold exploration assets
Mwana Africa owns gold exploration prospects in the DRC with currently defined resources totalling 638,290 ounces. The recoverable value of the Zani-Kodo prospect in the DRC has been calculated based on an estimate of fair value less costs to sell. The estimate has been calculated by reference to a sale of similar assets in the same area. In the previous year, an impairment charge of £4.3 million was recorded in respect of these assets to reduce their carrying value to £5.0 million, which was deemed to be appropriate, based on company comparable trading multiples at the time. As a result of changes in market conditions, the recoverable amount of Zani-Kodo has been estimated as being in excess of its carrying value before impairment. Consequently, the £4.3 million impairment recognised in the previous year has been reversed.
Base metal exploration assets
Mwana Africa holds exploration concessions in the Katanga province of the DRC. As at 31 March 2010, expenditure of £17.9 million (2009: £15.9 million) had been incurred on exploration at the concessions. Management estimated a recoverable value of £2.7 million on the basis of its fair value less costs to sell. Fair value was calculated by reference to a third party indicative offer received. Following impairment of £12.9 million recorded in the previous year, a further impairment charge of £2.3 million has been recorded.
Company ­ loans to subsidiaries
As a result of the events and circumstances described in this note, inter-company loans made by Mwana Africa PLC to Zani and SEMHKAT SPRL have been adjusted. The prior year's loan account impairment of £4.3 million for Zani has been reversed resulting in an increased carrying amount of £11 million. The loan account with SEMHKAT SPRL has been further impaired by £1.7 million (2009: £1,7 million) to a carrying amount of £2.7 million (2009: £3.0 million), and that with Ghanaian entities by £0.7 million (2009: £8.1 million) to a carrying amount of £0.8 million (2009: £2.0 million). The impairment reversal and an additional impairment charge have been recognised in the company's income statement. In 2009, inter-company loans with a carrying amount of £45.6 million were impaired by £27.7 million.

All current trade and other receivables are due within 12 months of the financial year-end. Receivables from group undertakings are due and payable on demand.
The group's exposure to credit and currency risks and impairment losses related to trade and other receivables is disclosed in note 31.
Other receivables include an amount of £3.2 million due to the group under foreign exchange control arrangements previously operating in Zimbabwe. Under these arrangements, the group has also recorded a liability of similar magnitude. These foreign exchange control arrangements ceased to operate in January 2009. The transitional arrangements for transactions existing but not settled at that date had not been finalised at the date of these financial statements. The group expects the receivable and the related liability to be set off against one another in due course, resulting in no net cash flow.

29. Pension scheme
Group
Certain of the group's Zimbabwean subsidiaries contribute towards defined contribution plans, details of which are provided below.
Mining Industry Pension Fund The Mining Industry Pension Fund is a defined contribution plan. The group's obligations under the scheme are limited to 5% of pensionable emoluments for lower grade employees and 10% for higher grade employees.

68

Others The group contributes towards personal pension schemes of certain of its employees, including certain directors, in South Africa and the United Kingdom.
The pension charge for the year represents contributions payable by the group to the various schemes and amounted to £151,695 (2009: £219,673).
There were no un-accrued or pre-paid contributions at either the beginning or end of the financial year.
Company
The company does not operate any pension schemes, but does make contributions towards personal pension schemes of its employees, including certain directors.
The pension charge for the year represents contributions payable by the company to the personal pension schemes and amounted to £90,775 (2009: £15,604 credit).
There were no un-accrued or pre-paid contributions at either the beginning or end of the financial year.
30. Share-based payments
Share options - employees
The company has outstanding options under an unapproved share option scheme adopted in 1997 which expired in September 2007 (the 1997 Scheme) and a new scheme which was approved by shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on 31 July 2007 (the 2007 Scheme).
1997 Scheme The company has operated this scheme since 1997 where options were granted to any employee, officer or director of the company or any subsidiary of the company. The limit for options granted under this scheme was not to exceed 15% of the number of issued ordinary shares from time to time.
The Board granted options at its discretion. The subscription price was fixed by the Board at the price per share on the dealing day preceding the date of grant.
For the directors, these options vest immediately and may be exercised at any time within a seven-year period from the date of the grant, unless the Board determines otherwise. The options lapse if not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the grant.
For the employees, there is a vesting period of one to three years from the date of grant. Once vested, the options may be exercised at any time within a seven-year period from date of grant, unless the Board determines otherwise. The options lapse if not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the grant.
The right to exercise an option terminates on the holder ceasing to be a participant, subject to certain exceptions, which broadly apply in the event of death of the option holder or where the option holder ceases to be a participant due to retirement, ill health, accident or redundancy. In such a case, the option may be exercised within six months of such event provided such exercise will take place within seven years of the original date of grant.
2007 Scheme The 2007 Scheme allows for both tax approved options (approved options) to be made to employees resident in the United Kingdom and unapproved options (unapproved options), which can be made to both resident and non-resident employees.
69

Notes to the annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2010 (continued)
30. Share-based payments (continued)
The company has operated this scheme since December 2007 where options may be granted to full-time employees and directors of the company or any subsidiary of the company. The overall limit for options granted under this scheme and any other employees' share scheme adopted by the company is, in any rolling ten-year period, 10% of the issued share capital (including treasury shares) of the company for the time being plus 8,100,000 ordinary shares. There is an individual limit of ordinary shares to a maximum of £30,000 in value in respect of approved options.
Options may be granted when the Remuneration Committee determines, within 42 days of the announcement by the company of its full or interim results. Options may be granted outside the 42-day period if the Remuneration Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances. Options must be granted subject to performance conditions being satisfied. The performance conditions must be objective and, save where the Remuneration Committee determines there to be exceptional circumstances, the performance conditions must relate to the overall financial performance of the company or the market value of ordinary shares over a period of at least three years. The performance conditions can be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee if it determines that a change of circumstances means that the performance conditions cannot reasonably be met. No consideration is payable on the grant of an option and no option may be granted after 31 July 2017.
The Remuneration Committee determines the exercise price before the options are granted and cannot be less than the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
The options can only be exercised on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the performance conditions have been satisfied. The options lapse if not exercised by the tenth anniversary of the grant.
These options lapse when the option holder ceases to be an eligible employee. In the case of death, a participant's personal representatives may exercise his/her options within 12 months after the date of death. Where an option holder ceases to be an employee by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, the company that employs the option holder ceasing to be a subsidiary of the company, retirement, pregnancy or in any other circumstances determined by the Remuneration Committee, the options may be exercised within six months of the termination of employment.
Other share-based payments
At the time of the acquisition of Freda Rebecca gold mine in 2005, the group agreed to sell a 15% interest in the company with a value of US$375,000 to a local investor. This option has vested immediately on inception and can be exercised at any time. Documentation and completion of the sale have yet to be concluded.
Share incentives The share incentive scheme was approved by shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on 31 July 2007 (the Share Incentive Scheme). The Share Incentive Scheme is designed to complement the Share Option Scheme to facilitate awards to selected executives and managers. The Share Incentive Scheme permits the award of any one or a combination of the following incentives:
the sale of ordinary shares on deferred payment terms; share awards as part of a bonus scheme by way of nil cost options in consideration of cash bonuses forgone on terms that would be determined by the Remuneration Committee of the company; and the issue of share appreciation rights either by the company or EBT (as defined below).
The company has also adopted an Employees' Benefit Trust (EBT) which will operate in conjunction with the Share Option Scheme and Share Incentive Scheme. The EBT has not yet been utilised for this purpose and there have been no awards under the Share Incentive Scheme since it was approved by shareholders.
The share options have been valued using a bi-nomial model.

31. Financial instruments
The directors determine, as required, the degree to which it is appropriate to use financial instruments, commodity contracts, other financial instruments or techniques to mitigate risks. The principal risks for which such instruments may be appropriate are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk. The most significant of these is foreign currency risk which comprises transactional exposure on operating activities. Some translation exposure also exists in respect of the investments in overseas operations, since these have functional currencies other than the group's reporting currency. The group is also exposed to commodity price risk since its sales are dependent on the price of nickel, gold and diamonds.

The group has not currently engaged any instruments in order to mitigate or hedge any such risks, although the directors keep this regularly under review.

Trade receivables of £884,583 (2009: £nil) were due to Freda Rebecca by the Zimbabwean Chamber of Mines, none of which was outstanding past its due date. Trade receivables of £2,866,294 (2009: £6,039,389) were receivable from a well-established commodities trader. None of the trade receivables was outstanding past its due date.

Based on historical default rates, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables as explained in note 4.

Sensitivity analysis
A 10% strengthening of pound sterling against the following currencies at 31 March and the average rate for the year ended 31 March would have increased/(decreased) equity and results before minority interest by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2009.

A 10% weakening of pound sterling against the above currencies would have had a similar but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

Commodity price risk
For the 2010 financial year, the group's earnings were mainly exposed to changes in the prices of nickel and gold, while in the previous year and prior to Freda Rebecca restarting production, exposure was mainly to nickel prices. A 10% increase and decrease would have increased/(decreased) equity and results by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2009.

Financial risk management

Fair values Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and willing parties. Wherever possible, fair value is calculated by reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. Where no such quoted prices are available, other observable inputs are used and if there are no observable inputs then fair values are calculated by discounting projected future cash flows at prevailing rates translated at year-end exchange rates.

Forward-looking statements
This report has been issued by, and is the sole responsibility of Mwana Africa PLC. This report includes `forward-looking statements'. Words such as `anticipates', `expects', `intends', `plans', `forecasts', `projects', `budgets', `believes', `seeks', `estimates', `could', `might', `should', and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including, without limitation, those regarding Mwana Africa's business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations and acquisition opportunities, are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors which could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Mwana Africa or the markets and economies in which Mwana Africa operates to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, political, regulatory and economic factors.
Factors that would cause actual results or events to differ from current expectations include, among other things, changes in commodity prices, changes in equity markets, failure to establish estimated mineral resources, political risks, changes to regulations affecting Mwana Africa's activities, delays in obtaining or failures to obtain required regulatory approvals, failure of equipment, uncertainties relating to the availability and costs of financing needed in the future, the uncertainties involved in interpreting drilling results and other geological data, delays in obtaining geological results, and other risks involved in the mineral exploration industry. Mwana Africa believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and accordingly undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein. Mwana Africa does not assume any responsibility to update any of such forward-looking statements, save as required by relevant law or regulatory authority. This report contains information regarding the results of various exploration activities. Where a mineral resource has not been defined, it should be noted that the potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource, and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.
Dr Charl du Plessis, Executive Vice President Exploration of Mwana Africa, who holds a PhD and is a Member of the AusIMM, is a `Qualified Person' as defined in the AIM Rules, and the exploration and resource development information contained in this report is based upon information prepared under the supervision of Dr Du Plessis, who has reviewed the information included herein. Dr Natasha Gibson Pr.Sci.Nat., Vice President, Exploration, is a `Qualified Person' as defined in the AIM Rules and is responsible for the technical information in this report relating to Mwana Africa's diamond production activities. The information relating to resources at BNC and Freda Rebecca is based on information prepared under the supervision of Claudius Makuni, Manager Geology for BNC and a `Qualified Person' as defined in the AIM Rules.
